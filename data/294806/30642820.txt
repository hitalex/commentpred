STOEBUCK Modern adverse possession is the successor to disseisin at common law, and it is common to refer to the adverse possessor as "disseisor"and the dispossessed owner as "disseisee". Though seisin originally meant only possession, by sometime before the reign of Henry II it denoted a tenancy of freehold, carrying with it the incidents of feudal tenure. Not until the eighteenth century was seisin thought of as an abstract right of ownership in the modern sense of "title." A disseisin was a wrongful putting out of seisin, not merely a dispossessing, which might be rightful, and implied both and entry and an ouster from the freehold. It is generally said that a disseisin, no matter how long continued, could not give title, which is not surprising, considering that seisin was not an abstract title.An Historical Introduction to the Land Law http://book.douban.com/subject/2463685/ 在Though seisin originally meant only possession这句话那里，作者标注，相关的书如上。
