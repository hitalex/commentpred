Nurse Maria Vatista draws blood from a Greek drug addict for an HIV test in a mobile testing van in Athens last year. HIV infection rates are rising, as Greece's financial crisis has led the government to cut health and social services, including a successful needle exchange program.About 20 recovering drug users gather daily at the Off Club, an outpatient community center in central Athens. On a recent day, one is making lunch wearing a surgical mask and gloves."We assume that everyone here either has AIDS or hepatitis C, so we have to be careful," says center director Panagiotis Saivanides.Greece's Latest Crisis: Rising HIV Casesby JOANNA KAKISSIShttp://www.npr.org/2012/07/27/157352062/greeces-latest-crisis-rising-hiv-cases?ft=3&f=1001&sc=nl&cc=nh-20120727

Schachter:It's a combination of sudden freedom to run things as you please and crushing responsibility in which you know you have to do certain things in a certain way at a certain time.That eradicates all of that freedom. You become a robot on rails. You know what you have to do and you are working in a certain direction.Maybe other people are different, but I think that every step was sort of the inevitable, inexorable progress due to the previous steps in the path. It's not like I had no choice, but everything I did was the only choice because it was the only thing that made sense at the time. It's not that long ago, but no regrets, that was the path to take. Everything that had to be done was done.http://www.douban.com/note/210839859/岁月描绘发际线思念不过眼前错眼错看错步断握痛手心抓不住永远

A squib is a form of firework, usually cylindrical in shape with a paper fuse at one end, which provides a mild explosion - think 'dynamite lite'. Clearly, fireworks work best when they are dry. Anyone who, at a backyard bonfire, has lit the blue touch paper and retired only to see the firework phut and fizzle out will know the disappointment of a damp squib.
