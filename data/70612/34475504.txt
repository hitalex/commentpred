摘要如下。所以大家需要专心学习的时候就去用糖水漱口吧。。The Gargle Effect: Rinsing the Mouth With Glucose Enhances Self-Control   Matthew A. Sanders, Steve D. Shirk, Chris J. Burgin, and Leonard L. MartinIn a recent study, Molden and colleagues (2012) found that glucose can enhance self-control even when it is not ingested, suggesting a motivational rather than metabolic source for self-control. Sanders and colleagues conceptually replicated this experiment by having participants perform a task requiring self-control (crossing out the letter "E" in a book) and then perform a Stroop task while rinsing their mouths with -- but not swallowing -- regular or sugarless lemonade. Those who rinsed with the regular lemonade performed better on the Stroop task than did those who had rinsed with the sugarless lemonade. This result supports Molden et al.'s (2012) findings in that it also suggests a nonmetabolic source for self-control.
