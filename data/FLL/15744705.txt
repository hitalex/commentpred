标题: 标题：[atcl M 0010] Indian universities to start credit transfer system
帖子内容: 
Tags:Jadavpur University|credit transfer system|Association of Indian UniversitiesKOLKATA: To encourage student mobility, the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) would soon chalk out modalities to introduce a credit transfer system between institutions along the lines of the varsities in the US, Canada and Europe. The association agreed to work out the modalities after accepting Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh's proposal in this regard at a recent AIU meeting. Ghosh argued for the system, saying the structural pattern of university education hasn't been reviewed for a long time. "As the second most populated country, the system is overburdened compared to available resources," he said. "Across the country, there are different systems in respect of academic calendars and details of curriculum framework isn't available." He said thanks to recent technological advances, students don't need to be confined to one educational institute. "There is no existing guideline to define the criteria required for students to go to another university and study for a specified period of time and bring back the credit earned to the first university. Such a system is prevalent in Europe," Ghosh added. He said students in various colleges affiliated to different universities in India aren't allowed to move within the country. "It debars the students from attending part of the course in another university of his choice, which could enrich the knowledge base. Indian institutes like JU and IITs have credit transfer systems with regulations with foreign universities," the VC said. He said children of parents with transferable jobs will benefit from the system. "In its absence, the students have to lose one academic year," he said. Read more: Indian universities to start credit transfer system - The Times of India http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indian-universities-to-start-credit-transfer-system/articleshow/6951247.cms#ixzz15h1xoDH0【上行】[atcl] media current http://www.douban.com/group/topic/12307737/
