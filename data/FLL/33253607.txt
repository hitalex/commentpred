内容：
US Election 2012Science and politics are uneasy bed-fellows. The first is built on evidence and objectivity; the second thrives on opinion and persuasion. Nowhere is that relationship more fraught than in the United States, where the need to win votes can trump scientific evidence on issues such as climate change and public health - and where scientists have little sympathy for political give and take. Nature scrutinizes the intersection of politics and science in the run-up to the US election on Tuesday 6 November.http://www.nature.com/news/specials/election2012/index.html
