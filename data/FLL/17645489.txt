【语言】English is the text-book example of a language that expands its vocabulary by unashamedly raiding other languages. For a thousand years new words have, like dockside imports, often borne an easily readable stamp of their country of origin: outlaw from medieval Scandinavia, gentle from medieval France, madrigal from Renaissance Italy, chutney from nineteenth-century India and karate from twentieth-century Japan, to name a few examples that indicate the chronological and geographical range. Such words clearly and interestingly reflect the contact that English-speaking peoples have had with other countries and other cultures, and so fascinated have scholars been for several generations by the patterns of word adoption that we have tended to regard this process as virtually the sole means by which changes in our vocabulary take place.  It is not, of course. We sometimes translate the foreign word we need, as Bernard Shaw did with Nietzsche's Uebermensch to produce superman; or we achieve a new means of designation by using an existing word in a different sense, as with the homosexual meaning of gay. Or -to come to the concern of the present book - we can permute existing words and parts of words to make new combinations such as the nouns boathouse, houseboat, or the adjective ungovernable.   With all of these devices, we see vocabulary change triggered off by cultural change even where no transparently 'exotic' word appears as a result: the homely corn becomes the American word for the exotic maize when and because Americans start encountering maize in their daily life. But changes in vocabulary by the processes of word-formation have, in addition to their cultural and historical interest, a purely linguistic interest.  That is to say, there are abstractly describable patterns which explain the regularities in the new words we coin and which explain also why certain formations would be unlikely or impossible (such as a negative adjective *ableungovern). By contrast, there are few generalizations that one could make in predicting the shape or internal structure of foreign words that we might adopt. Thus, although foreign words are normally given a 'domesti-cated' pronunciation, we cannot even say that an adopted word will be repronounced with only English sounds and sound sequences (raison d' etre).  This is not to say that there are rules of word-formation as freely available to the native speaker as his rules of sentence-formation. Where almost every sentence we use is composed ad hoc to suit the occasion and is thus a 'new sentence', it is relatively rare for us to form a 'new word' and when we do our hearers or readers are more or less conscious both of its newness and of the rarity with which they encounter the phenomenon of newness. Even so, they would be generally able to distinguish a new word that seemed well-formed ('This wretched cupboard is ungetinable) from one that is not (*getunablein). To this extent, word-formation is interestingly rule-bound and Valerie Adams gives careful consideration to the many complex kinds of regularity that are to be observed. She deserves especial praise, however, for resisting the temptation to sweep under an exquisitely patterned carpet the irregularities and striking idiosyncrasies which are -to say the least - no less characteristic of the creative side of lexical usage.  The volume makes a welcome contribution in a difficult and controversial field. As English has increasingly come into world-wide use, there has arisen an acute need for more information on the language and the ways in which it is used. The English Language Series seeks to meet this need and to play a part in further stimulating the study and teaching of English by providing up-to-date and scholarly treatments of topics most relevant to present-day English - including its history and traditions, its sound patterns, its grammar, its lexicology, its rich variety in speech and writing, and its standards in Britain, the USA and the other principal areas where the language is used.  The study of word-formation offers a great many puzzles to the present-day student of language; as Esko Pennanen (1972) observes in a discussion of some of the difficulties, not the least of these is its status as a branch of linguistic study. I have not tried in this book to grapple with major issues, such as the possibility of devising rules to account for just those compounds and affixed words which exist and are acceptable, and those which could exist and would be acceptable if they were to be formed; or the possibility of giving convincing reasons why some words are unacceptable while Others of similar make-up are not. In the final pages I suggest - as others have recently suggested - that if we are to make much progress in understanding such matters, the topic of 'word-formation' as it is here defined may have to be recognized as after all rather superficially conceived: our real business should be with meanings and how they are expressed and Combined. Questions like these, however, await a better understanding of many syntactic and semantic matters; they are for the future, and for works far more ambitious than this one.  The chapters which follow are chiefly concerned with data, and with classifications of data. As an introduction to the subject, they cannot claim to be complete, since a comprehensive treatment of the prefixes and suffixes is lacking. But I have tried to indicate to some extent, though in no Very systematic way, how the various traditionally-recognized patterns of word-formation are interrelated; how, for instance, the make-up of noun compounds, verb compounds and compounds containing particles may be considered along with the patterns of zero derivation; how blends and compounds may be compared; how compound-elements and blend-elements may be more, or less, like prefixes and suffixes; and how certain concepts, such as 'instrumentality', 'location', 'resemblance', appear and re-appear in words of various types.  Throughout, I have included illustrative examples gathered from the most recent sources, chiefly from newspapers and magazines. I believe that such transient coinages are valuable in helping us - and occasionally surprising us - when the dictionary lets us down. I have used them to show, for instance, how we are capable of making new compound verbs, such as to chauffeur-drift, or to consumer-test; and how patterns which we might have thought were played out are still alive. Thus we are able to form adjective compounds like browfurrowed and yawning dull on the patterns of the cliche-like heart-broken and scalding hot; and the little group of 'animal' verbs such as to ape, to wolf, gets a new member with the coining of to squirrel Examples from these sources also provide interesting evidence of how word-elements of all kinds may be taken up and used in new formations. It was as natural for the Victorian journalist of the 1880's to coin the word camelcade for a procession or cavalcade of camels as it was for the reporter of the 1960s; and Sir Thomas More might have been surprised to learn that his invention, Utopia, was to serve as a precedent for such twentieth-century creations as pornotopia.http://library.nu/docs/6W4LPFVMJS/An%20Introduction%20to%20Modern%20English%20Word%20Formation%20%28English%20Language%20Series%29

【stay-at-home mothers in UK 】 Welfare reforms could force stay-at-home mothers to workBy JAMES CHAPMANLast updated at 3:50 PM on 18th February 2011Tens of thousands of stay-at-home mothers could be forced to look for work when their youngest child reaches five under sweeping reforms to the benefits system.Unveiling the Welfare Reform Bill yesterday, David Cameron said ministers were determined to end the culture of benefits dependency and ‘make work pay’.The changes wipe out ‘perverse incentives’ blamed for putting off many from taking a job.They also introduce sanctions that could see those who refuse work lose benefits for up to three years.But documents released yesterday could also impact on single-income families who boost their income with tax credits.In future, some mothers who choose to stay at home while their partners go out to work will be treated in the same way as single mothers if they want to claim the new Universal Credit.Those affected would have to look for work when their youngest child reaches five.If they fail to make themselves available for work, they could have their Credit payment docked.Officials were last night unable to say how many families would be affected by the change – which appears to run counter to the Coalition’s stated philosophy of giving mothers the choice to stay at home to look after their children.But it could affect tens of thousands of mothers of school-age children who currently qualify for tax credits or other benefits – particularly if their partners work part-time.It is likely to affect those mothers whose partners work for fewer than 24 hours a week, but the threshold has yet to be finalised.Officials last night insisted the Government was not ‘declaring war’ on stay-at-home mothers.A source said: ‘We accept that looking after your children is the most important job any parent does. Those affected will be steered towards part-time work. We are not saying don’t look after your children.’The Universal Credit is designed to ‘make work pay’ by replacing a complex array of benefits and tax credits.Launching the reforms yesterday, Mr Cameron said the package amounted to ‘the most ambitious, fundamental and radical changes to the welfare system’.The new system will remove rules which mean some on low incomes face an effective tax rate of up to 96 per cent because their benefits are withdrawn as their earnings rise. The changes will ensure those coming off welfare or increasing their hours can keep 35p of benefits for every extra £1 they take home, benefiting an estimated 1.5million low-earners.In return, those on benefits will face tough sanctions if they refuse to look for work. In the most serious cases, repeat offenders could lose benefits for up to three years.The Prime Minister said the changes were ‘tough, radical, but fair’. He added: ‘Never again will work be the wrong financial choice. We’re finally going to make work pay – especially for the poorest people in society.‘And we’re going to provide much greater support for unemployed people to find work.’Mr Cameron said the £90billion annual welfare bill accounted for one in every £7 spent by the Government and was ‘simply not sustainable’. And he said perverse incentives and complexities within the existing system had ‘insidiously drained hope away from swathes of our society’ and actively encouraged people to behave in ways which were irresponsible.Mr Cameron said the changes would slash £5.5billion from the welfare bill in real terms over the next four years by limiting housing benefit, reforming tax credits and taking child benefit away from higher-rate taxpayers.But documents released yesterday showed that the introduction of the UniversalCredit in 2013 will cost taxpayers at least £2.6billion.A total of 2.7million households will be entitled to higher benefits as a result of the Universal Credit. Estimates suggest 950,000 people will be lifted out of poverty.And about 1.7million households will lose out in the long-term.The plans also impose a cap of £26,000 on the benefits a family can receive in any one year.This will see 50,000 families lose an average £93 a week in handouts, with almost a third of those affected being single mothers with more than five children.But plans to cut housing benefit entitlement by 10 per cent for those out of work for more than a year have been dropped.The reform package came under attack from unions.TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: ‘Long-term unemployment has doubled not because of a sudden increase in work-shy scroungers, but as an inevitable result of economic policies based on cuts that destroy growth.’But Mr Cameron said the reforms were essential to prevent a repeat of the last decade, when new jobs were taken by migrant workers rather than those on benefits.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1358213/Welfare-reforms-force-stay-home-mothers-work.html

【Health - Cold】6 Questions About the Common Cold, Answeredfrom Instant Health Answers1. How long can I use a nasal spray  for a stuffy nose?Two to 3 days. Over-the-counter sprays containing phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine) or oxymetazoline (Afrin, Dristan) shrink swollen blood vessels in the lining of your nose, allowing trapped mucus to drain. The good thing about the sprays is that they work almost instantaneously, and they won’t keep you awake at night or cause other side effects typical of oral decongestants. The downside is that, after 3 to 5 days, they can cause rebound congestion — the more you use them, the faster your nose gets stuffed up again after each spray, leading you to use more and more. To avoid this problem, some experts recommend using a spray for no more than 2 to 3 days at a time. Then stop for 3 days. If you’re still congested, it’s okay to use it again for 2 to 3 days.2. Every time I renew my efforts to go to the gym, I seem to catch a cold. Is it all in my head?You may be on to something. Intense exercise can decrease levels of infection-fighting white blood cells in your body temporarily and boost levels of stress hormones that may interfere with your immune system’s ability to fight off cold viruses. Coupled with the possibility that you’re picking up germs from gym equipment or in the locker room, your workouts might very well be making you sick.That doesn’t mean that all exercise opens the door to colds. In fact, a consistent, medium-intensity routine is a proven cold-stopper. Taking a brisk, 40-minute walk 4 days a week, for example, can cut the number of colds you experience by 25 to 50 percent and can make the colds you do catch shorter by half, studies show. Moderate exercise boosts the number and activity level of important immune-system players called natural killer cells.3. How do I know if it’s a cold or the flu?Take your temperature and assess how you feel. If you have influenza, you will likely have a temperature (101°F or higher) and terrible headache, feel achy all over, and be incredibly tired. It’s rare to have a significant fever with a cold. The primary symptoms of a cold are a stuffy and/or runny nose, cough, and sore throat, which rarely occur with the flu. While you may feel tired if you have a cold, with the flu, you probably won’t be able to get out of bed.4. Is there really a wrong way to blow your nose?Mom was right about this one. Vigorous honking really is counterproductive for two reasons. First, it triggers “reflex nasal congestion” — your nasal passages swell up temporarily, which traps mucus. Second, full-force nose blowing creates a vacuum deep in your sinus passages; once you stop blowing, mucus gets sucked backward, deeper into your sinuses. A better way to blow: With a tissue over both nostrils, close one side and gently blow the other for 3 to 5 seconds. Switch sides. It may take several blows, but it works.5. If I have a runny nose from a cold, am I better off drying it up or letting it go?Go ahead and make yourself comfortable. Congestion and a runny nose are side effects of your body’s efforts to fight off the viral infections that cause colds and flu. Reversing them with a decongestant won’t slow down healing and may in fact help you avoid complications like a sinus infection.To clear your nose, decongestants containing pseudoephedrine are more effective than those containing phenylephrine. A British study of 283 women and men with stuffy noses found that those who took 60 milligrams of pseudoephedrine reported a 30 percent drop in congestion after just one dose.6. Should I take echinacea all the time or just during cold season?Don’t take echinacea every day, year-round. It’s not known for certain, but there’s reason to worry that taking this herb for longer than 2 months at a time may cause serious side effects, such as liver damage. Instead, use it in specific situations.• Before cold season. To use echinacea to prevent the sniffles, start taking it a week or two before cold season starts. That’s a tricky date to pin down, depending on where you live, though in many parts of the world, that means late summer or early fall. If you take echinacea for the entire cold season, take at least a 1 week break every 2 months.• At the first signs of a cold. Start taking it right away and you might feel better sooner.• Before you fly. You might consider starting it a week before you’ll be exposed to others who might have colds, such as traveling by air, says University of Connecticut professor of pharmacy Craig I. Coleman, PharmD.The usual dose is 900 milligrams per day of echinacea extract or 2,700 milligrams of dried herb powder.http://www.rd.com/health/6-questions-about-the-common-cold-answered/

有关炒股必备词汇要投资股票，不管是要交给“股票经纪”stock broker操作，还是要以“散户”individual investor 的身份自行操盘，你都得先学会看懂上市公司在“股市行情表”stock index上的资讯。现在我们就来看看股市行情表上一些英文简写的含义。第一个就是Sym，就是symbol的缩写，是一种股票的市场代号。Div，是dividend的缩写，表示“股利”，代表每股从公司年度利润中可以分到的红利。Vol，“成交量”，是volume的缩写。Yld%，是yield rate的缩写，意思是“收益率”，表示投资这一种股票可以获利的百分比。如果你的目标是“高获利”，也就是high margin，就要选择收益率高的股票。PE，本益比，price-earning ratio的缩写，用来判断一种股票被“高估”overvalue还是“低估”undervalue。Hi and Lo，最高与最低价，也就是high 和low的缩写，是这一种股票当日出现的最高与最低成交价。Close，收盘价，是closing price的缩写，表示当日收盘的“面值”，face price。最后，就是Net Chg，是net change的缩写，表示“涨跌”。说到这个涨跌呢，是股市中每天都会有的正常现象，也是投资股票之所以有趣的重要因素。在英语中有很多生动的说法，来表现涨跌的变化。一般说到“涨”，小幅度的上涨可以说，rise，gain或者climb，而大幅度的涨则是surge，soar或者jump，甚至可以用“火箭一飞冲天”skyrocket来形容，现在我们来举几个例子：The market gained two hundred points today in heavy trading. 股市今天在交易火爆的情况下，上涨了两百个点。还有，Shares in MSFT skyrocketed today after strong 4th quarter profit reports. 在第四季优异的盈利报告之后，微软的股票今天向上狂飙。再来说说“跌”的表示方法，这里也有很多说法，“微微下挫”是drop，fall，decline或者slip，严重一点可以“下沉”，sink，plunge，或者plummet，或是“被槌子重击”get hammered来形容。最惨的就是“崩盘”，crash 或者collapse的“一下到底”hit bottom。不然就是“直线下滑”sky dive，nose dive，或者head south这类字眼。我们来举几个例子：News of 911 attacks caused the markets to collapse. 911攻击事件造成股市崩盘。HSI plummeted across the board today. 香港恒生指数今天全面下挫。股市上还会有涨跌互见的现象，可以用mixed这个词表示“涨跌互见”这个意义。如果上下起伏激烈，可以用roller coaster ride形容指数上上下下好像“搭云霄飞车”，至于让投资人最兴奋的，莫过于听到盘中走势“开低走高”，就是rebound或者rally；要是相反，“开高走低”，就是pull back。如果股市表现平平，以“平盘”收尾，我们就说unchanged，表示没什么变化，或者用flat来表示“差价不大”。我们来举几个例子：The oil market rebounded today after several days of decline. 几天连续下挫之后，石油市场在今天逆势上扬。The high-tech stocks were mixed today. MSFT was unchanged. 高科技类股长跌互见。微软公司则平盘收尾。这里还要说一下的是，在美国红色表示“赤字”deficit，所以股价若用红色显示，就是“下挫”的意思了。这正好跟中国认为红色吉利，用红色表示“上涨”的情形相反。说到红色吉利，顺便来说说预期心理，这是大多数股市投资人会有的心态，英语中用两种动物来做为涨跌的代表，我想大家都知道吧，就是“牛” bull和“熊”bear，分别代表“涨”和“跌”，所以你可以说，I'm bullish/bearish on the financial stocks. 我预期金融类股票会涨/跌。我们现在就用一个股市投资人的例子提醒大家，当初因为他太贪心，想做个投机的短线投资人，也就是speculative day trader，狠狠地赚一笔就杀出，所以净是投资一些“高风险的股票”high-risk，新兴“网络股” dot-com stock和“高科技股”high-tech stock，而忽略了“绩优股”blue-chip。结果那些股票很快就变成了“低价股”penny stock，这下可就惨了。所以如果你也有朋友在炒股的话，可以用下面的这些话劝劝他。You'd lose your shirt investing in penny stocks. 投资那些低价股会让你输得精光。You should hold on to those blue-chip stocks even if the market is going down. 就算股市下滑，你也应该继续持有那些绩优股。Don't put all your eggs in one basket. 别把全部的鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里。就是说不要把钱全部投到一支股票上。 http://waiyu.kaoshibaike.com/fect/gfect/baoxian/201011/363181.html

【职业】The 50 Best Careers of 2011Consider these high-opportunity jobs as you look for your next paycheckBy ALEXIS GRANTPosted: December 6, 2010Tips for Landing Jobs on Our Best Careers ListVideo: Best Careers 2011It pays to be smart when choosing your career, particularly now that the job market is (slowly) improving. With the recession officially over, anyone who's out of work or eager to change jobs is on the lookout for opportunities. But where, exactly, are the jobs? Which occupations offer decent salaries, quality of life—and are likely to stick around for the next decade?Our list of 50 Best Careers answers those questions. We've highlighted dozens of high-opportunity professions—careers you may want to consider as you decide where to look for your next paycheck. Based on job-growth projections, salary data, and other factors like job satisfaction, these occupations span a variety of industries, so you can find the right position for you no matter what your interests.What's new on the list this year? Several of our picks reflect the recent uptick in the economy, while others are long-time contenders that finally muscled their way onto the roster. With an aging baby boomer generation, healthcare continues to make a strong showing. All of the healthcare jobs on last year's list have made the cut again this year, plus two new positions: massage therapist and athletic trainer. While the field of athletic training doesn't offer the sheer number of positions as nursing or dental hygiene, it outranks nearly all other healthcare occupations for expected job growth.[See Tips for Landing Jobs on Our List.]Technology positions also account for a good chunk of our top-choice careers. Computer support specialist joins the ranks this year with upward trending employment numbers. Education administrator, which ranked particularly high for job satisfaction, made it onto our lineup of social service jobs. In the business category, we added sales manager, an occupation that's making a comeback along with the economy.On our creative and service jobs list, heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration technician is new this year, largely because of its high expected job growth. Interpreter/translator, an occupation that's increasingly in demand as a result of globalization, also made the cut.To come up with this year's list, U.S. News considered job-growth projections from the Labor Department, estimates for 2008 to 2018, the most recent data available. We narrowed it down to occupations that are expected to add jobs at an above-average rate over the next decade, as well as those that provide an above-average median income. Sales manager makes the highest median annual salary on our list, nearly $97,000. Computer software engineer, physician assistant, meteorologist and education administrator all bring in median average salaries in the mid-$80,000 range.We also considered, where possible, data on job satisfaction, turnover, and impending retirements, which crank up openings in jobs that may have only slightly above-average employment growth. We talked with labor and industry experts as well, gathering anecdotal evidence about employment prospects and job satisfaction. We excluded careers that lack a statistically significant number of positions and therefore provide opportunity for only a small number of workers. When necessary, we favored jobs that would help diversify our list in terms of category and educational requirements, since not everyone wants to work in healthcare or go to school for six years.[See 10 Smart Ways to Use Social Media in Your Job Search.]Most of the jobs that were cut from the list this year showed a higher-than-average unemployment rate or shrinking employment numbers during the last few quarters. From the creative and service jobs category, funeral director, plumber, security system installer, and landscape architect got the boot. In business, we cut market research analyst, loan officer, and cost estimator.Of course, no one job is best for everyone, and everyone has their own ideas about what makes a job great. "You have to like what you're doing or you're not going to be successful at it," says Emily Bennington, who helps college graduates transition into careers through her company, Professional Studio 365. At the same time, "if you're not getting paid to do it, you're not going to love it for very long."Qualities that make a job desirable also change with the times and circumstances. Tom Smith, director of the General Social Survey, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, expects his next set of job-satisfaction data to show that workers value stability more than they did before the recession. "Occupations that have greater job stability perhaps have improved in the public's evaluation," he says.[For more career advice, visit U.S. News Careers, or find us on Facebook or Twitter.]Even as hiring picks up, the odds can seem daunting to job seekers. In a struggling economy with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate, competition is stiff even for some jobs that made our list. For every job opening in September, there were about five unemployed people, according to the Labor Department. While that's an improvement from 6.2 people for every job opening in November 2009, the most recent peak, "it's still a very tough job market," says Steve Hipple, an economist at the Labor Department. During the three years before the recession, the rate averaged 1.7 unemployed people for every job opening.Others like John Challenger, CEO of outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas, are more optimistic.
