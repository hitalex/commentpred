university和college有什么区别？http://www.douban.com/group/topic/1508328/2007-03-24 14:10:34 云文 (北京)　　The difference between a college and a university is that a college just offers a collection of degrees in one specific area, while a university is a collection of colleges. When you go to a university you are going to be graduating from one of their colleges, such as the business college. As to which is better, it depends on what you want. Single colleges tend to be smaller while universities are bigger, but universities are better known. 　　 　　Explanations from other FAQ Farmers: 　　 　　 * Be aware that there is a very distinct difference in terminology between the USA and the rest of the world. In the US, there is very little difference academically between a "college" and a "university". Universities are usually larger and often contain multiple "colleges" within them. However, some of the top-ranked schools in the US have a name including "college" (ex. Dartmouth College). In other parts of the English-speaking world, the term "university" equates to the US use of "college" and the term "college" refers more to a trade or vocational school. Wikipedia has a page that describes the differences at wikipedia.org 　　 　　 * Depends on the country you are in. Here in the UK, a university can award its own degrees and has a charter giving it various guarantees of independence. A college usually depends on a fully-fledged university validating its degrees, or may even be part of a university, as in Oxford or Cambridge colleges. Or a college may be little to do with degree-level education at all, such as a Further Education college. 　　 　　 * Also don't forget Community Colleges. In that usage a college is very different than a University because a community college can't offer a 4 year degree (ie a B.A. or a B.S.). Community colleges can offer trade and technical certifications and training as well as the first 2 years of a four year program but they are unable to grant bachelors degrees. 　　 　　 * In Canada a University is an education insitution that can grant degrees. (BA, BSc, MA, PHd, etc). Colleges can grant certificates or diplomas, but not degrees. 　　 　　 * Maybe in Canada only, that universities are different with college. Most countries except Canada (developing or developed countries), colleges offers four (4) year course - Bachelor's Degree. Of course, universities are more prestigious and more expensive. Also, universities offers further studies after Bachelor's Degree like Master's Degrees, Doctorate Degree, and Post Doctorate Degree - These degrees can be achieved if you have earned Bachelor's Degree first. Basically, college are small and faculties (such as lecturers) are more focused to students. They usually focused on few courses (for Bachelor's Degree). In universities, professors handles more students and they most likely can't focused on each students. For your information, universities comprises of colleges with different courses. Colleges internationally maybe small, but some colleges (like in usa and others) have better standards than some universites.... 　　 　　 * Australia is in the same boat as Canada then. Here, Universities offer degress, but Colleges, (also known as T.A.F.E.,) offer Diplomas and Certificates. 　　 　　 * In France, college “Grande Ecole” is highly reputing than University especially in Engineering. It is part of National Polytechnic Institute taking into account the selection criteria. 　　 　　 * A university confers degress up to PhD. A 4-year college confers Bachelors and Masters degrees. (BA,BS & MA, MS) A 2-year or community college confers the associate degree. ( AA or AS) 　　 　　 * Universities offer more degrees than colleges offer. 　　 　　 * The difference between a college and a university is that a college just offers a collection of degrees in one specific area, while a university is a collection of colleges. When you go to a university you are going to be graduating from one of their colleges, such as the business college. As to which is better, it depends on what you want. Single colleges tend to be smaller while universities are bigger, but universities are better known.

SUVSUV Democrat n. A politician (particularly one who is a member of the U.S. Democratic Party) who talks about energy conservation but who owns and drives a fuel-inefficient sport utility vehicle. Example Citation:"Not to her great credit, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein owns a gas-guzzling SUV, even though she believes in global warming and doesn't want to drill in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In fact, last year the Los Angeles Times reported that she owned three SUVs. Which makes her your perfect 'SUV Democrat.'"—Debra J. Saunders, "Close SUV Loophole," The San Francisco Chronicle, May 10, 2001 Notes:The phrase sport utility vehicle (SUV) entered the language in the 1970s, although in its earliest incarnations it most often shows up as sports utility vehicle (as well as sports-utility vehicle and sports/utility vehicle): "Four-wheel drive is increasingly popular. A decade ago, about the only U.S.-made '4 by 4's,' as the industry calls them, were Jeeps and International Harvester's Scouts. Today every truck manufacturer offers four-wheel drive not only on sports utility vehicles but also on pickups — where it is a more and more common option — and suburbans as well."—Charles G. Burck, "Trucks Muscle in on the Car Market," Fortune, February 27, 1978  The abbreviation SUV didn't get a toe-hold in the lexicon until about 10 years later: "Ford, meanwhile, is planning to freshen up or completely redesign all of its light-truck recreational vehicle products in the early 1990s, in part to take full advantage of expected demand in the SUV segment of the market."—Al Wrigley, "Ford picks Budd to supply Bronco II components," Metalworking News, June 29, 1987

jump the shark v. In a television show, to include an over-the-top scene or plot twist that is indicative either of an irreversible decline in the show's quality or of a desperate bid to stem the show's declining ratings. Also: JTS.—jump-the-shark adj.—jumping the shark pp. Example Citations:On the day of its final episode, we ponder: Just when did "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" jump the shark? A. When bad-boy lover vampire Angel left for his own series. B. When sidekick Willow discovered she was a lesbian. C. When Buffy got a kid sister. D. When the show moved to UPN. Maybe each of those was a nail in the coffin, along with the musical episode and Buffy having sex with former vampire nemesis Spike.—Walt Belcher, "Fangs for the memories," Tampa Tribune, May 20, 2003 The phrase "jump the shark" has enjoyed such a vogue in recent months, I'm surprised it didn't turn up on the list of overused words and expressions put out by Lake Superior State University this month. Yet, your friendly neighborhood TV critic feels compelled to point out that one of the reasons the term is used so much is it's just so useful. Coined by Jon Hein at the University of Michigan back in the '80s, it refers to the moment when something — particularly a TV series — peaks and begins to go downhill into self-parody and decay. It originally referred to the "Happy Days" episode in which Fonzie literally tried to jump a shark in a daredevil water-skiing stunt. Me, I think "Happy Days" jumped the shark a lot earlier than that — like when Richie's older brother, Chuck, conveniently disappeared after the first season — but "lose the brother" would be even more difficult to explain than "jump the shark." Anyway, it's obvious to see why the phrase is such a natural for critics. And the concept of if or when a certain series jumped the shark is such a natural source of debate, it has produced a cottage industry for Hein in the form of a trademarked Web site and now a companion book, "Jump the Shark: When Good Things Go Bad." (My favorite notation on the site is the Chicago viewer who suggested "Bozo's Circus" jumped the shark when Sandy the Tramp left to produce "The Banana Splits.") So, it being a new year and all, now seems a good time to review the current prime-time programs and which have jumped the shark and when. The official jumptheshark.com Web site helps out with handy categories, such as "I Do" (see weddings, as on "I Dream of Jeannie"), "Exit ... Stage Left" (departures, like Suzanne Somers leaving "Three's Company"), "Same Character, Different Actor" (Dick Sargent replacing Dick York on "Bewitched") and "A Very Special..." as in "A very special 'Blossom'."—Ted Cox, "Jumping the shark," Chicago Daily Herald, January 23, 2003 Earliest Citation:There is a flip side to this, of course, at least in television, namely a moment when you realize that the series is going downhill, the standard has been lost and convention has taken over. It's called to "jump the shark".—Jeff Abramowitz, "It's all down hill," Jerusalem Post, May 29, 1998

Huang wasted no time in jumping on the real estate gravy train of 2004, when real estate was just beginning to take off. At that time a house in urban Beijing was priced at around RMB 4-5,000 per square meter. Some real estate companies even waived down-payments in their eagerness to attract buyers. With his parents’ help, Huang became the owner of two apartments. “I paid them off soon afterwards, and later mortgaged my third house,” he recalls.

In 2006, Credit Suisse carried out a consumer market survey in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chengdu and Xi’an. The 2,700 respondents from these eight big cities were of diverse income levels. Of those intending to buy property within one year, 53 percent were moving from property already purchased to that of a higher standard, 23 percent were first-time buyers, 13 percent had investment in mind, and 5 percent were buying for relatives. The survey established that 7.7 percent of property purchases after 2004 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and other cities had been for investment purposes, the respective ratios in Beijing and Shanghai being 12.4 and 9.3 percent.

Chinese stock took off at the beginning of 2006 after a five-year hiatus. This turnabout impressed investors, particularly individuals, as manifest in the 80 or more million accounts that opened in the securities market. Institutional investors gathered strength, and there was also an extraordinary increase in investment funds. Of the 87 newly released funds of 2006, seven amassed more than RMB 10 billion. In a central bank survey of 20 thousand citizens from 50 small, medium and large cities in the first quarter of 2007, 30.3 percent believed the time was right time to close fixed deposit accounts and move their savings into stocks and funds. In its subsequent report, the central bank confirmed that, since May 2006, a large proportion of funds that would otherwise have been placed in fixed deposits have been absorbed into China’s bullish stock market.

They imagine they can make a fortune overnight from speculation.” Yang Shen makes investors aware of risks because, as he says, “They don’t study companies’ performances, preferring to be guided by the grapevine or general trends.

CHINESE people like to bank their cash; this is evident in the 300 million deposit accounts currently in existence. China’s national savings ratio approaches 50 percent, and 30 percent of its income is from family savings, says Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, in a recently published economic report. All things considered, the people of China, compared with those of other nations, are ostensibly keen depositors. Bank deposits in 2006 amounted to a total of RMB 1,642 trillion -- RMB 209 trillion more than 2006 -- according to statistical data published by the People’s Bank of China show. Yet the rate of increase was RMB 112.5 billion lower than that of 2004 to 2005. Although fixed deposit accounts are generally regarded as a main financial asset, only 59.4 percent of respondents to a People's Bank of China survey in the first quarter of 2007 were regular depositors. So, if it isn’t in the bank, where exactly is all this moola? To many Chinese savers, the booming real estate and bullish stock markets of 2006 presented far preferable alternatives to the safe but low-profit fixed bank deposit. Big Bucks in Bricks and Mortar Huang Xiaojun works in the China World Trade Center. When he first came to Beijing in 2004, he rented an apartment in a longstanding community close to his downtown company. It was after talking to his landlord that Huang realized the full lucrative potential of real estate. His landlord is a retired Beijing resident who lives largely on his rental income. “He has four houses, all in business or school areas. If each house brings him, say, RMB 2,000 a month, he must make at least RMB 8,000,” Huang calculates.Huang wasted no time in jumping on the real estate gravy train of 2004, when real estate was just beginning to take off. At that time a house in urban Beijing was priced at around RMB 4-5,000 per square meter. Some real estate companies even waived down-payments in their eagerness to attract buyers. With his parents’ help, Huang became the owner of two apartments. “I paid them off soon afterwards, and later mortgaged my third house,” he recalls. Huang made his first real estate sale - an 80 square meter apartment he had bought for RMB 300,000 -- in 2006 “As it’s only a couple of meters from the CBD I sold it for RMB 800,000,” says Huang happily. In 2006, Credit Suisse carried out a consumer market survey in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chengdu and Xi’an. The 2,700 respondents from these eight big cities were of diverse income levels. Of those intending to buy property within one year, 53 percent were moving from property already purchased to that of a higher standard, 23 percent were first-time buyers, 13 percent had investment in mind, and 5 percent were buying for relatives. The survey established that 7.7 percent of property purchases after 2004 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and other cities had been for investment purposes, the respective ratios in Beijing and Shanghai being 12.4 and 9.3 percent. Certain experts believe this is to be a conservative representation of the property speculation phenomenon. Almost 40 percent of property purchases within the Shanghai Outer Ring Road were for investment purposes, while the ratio in many medium-size cities was around 30 percent. This is well in excess of the internationally recommended 20 percent limit.“Taking into account the average level of income, housing prices should be lower,” says Chen Changhua, director of the China Research Department at Credit Suisse, “but in the present situation there are insufficient channels for those seeking to invest their available capital. As real estate provides a major investment opportunity, keeping property prices at a reasonable level is difficult, especially when property investment is also a main source of income.”Government macroeconomic control policies and hikes in bank interest rate effectively cooled the property market. It is no longer a good time to invest in real estate. The average rental on standard apartments has increased by just three percent, as compared to the ten percent scope of increase in commercial residential buildings, explains Mr. Zhang, manager of the Chaoyang Road Branch of Homelink. Registered owner houses that have been sold by his letting agency show an upward trend, but still lag way behind those of 2006. “Taking into account taxes and fees, as well as rising mortgage interest, investors can only expect to break even if the price of their property increases 11 percent - a rate of growth even new houses have no chance of achieving,” Mr. Zhang confirms, glumly.But people still want their bricks and mortar. The latest trend in the property market is to buy real estate outside of Beijing. A sample survey by Mayer Advertising shows that around 46 percent of Beijing citizens sought property in other cities in 2006, compared to the 22 percent of 2004. Since June 2006, more than 30 provincial property companies have come to Beijing for sales promotion purposes, some of them from coastal cities of Shandong and Hebei Provinces, according to data published by Centaline China Property Consultancy, Investing in a Bull MarketIt was on February 27th 2007 that the biggest drop in the Chinese stock market for a decade occurred. Cao Min nevertheless opened a stock exchange account the next day. She was acting on the advice of a colleague, who had told her that the best time to enter the market is when stock has substantially fallen. “A friend of mine speculated in stock last year and made a fortune twice over, something that would be impossible with a fixed bank deposit,” Cao Min reports, excitedly. The same colleague also warned Cao Min of the risk, but she went ahead nonetheless. During March 2007, 2.4 million more individual investors joined the stock market, according to China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited statistical data. On an average trading day 100,000 new accounts open, but on March 1 2007 there were a record 170 thousand new accounts. Altogether 1.5 million new fund accounts opened in the month of March. Chinese stock took off at the beginning of 2006 after a five-year hiatus. This turnabout impressed investors, particularly individuals, as manifest in the 80 or more million accounts that opened in the securities market. Institutional investors gathered strength, and there was also an extraordinary increase in investment funds. Of the 87 newly released funds of 2006, seven amassed more than RMB 10 billion.

In its subsequent report, the central bank confirmed that, since May 2006, a large proportion of funds that would otherwise have been placed in fixed deposits have been absorbed into China’s bullish stock market.But beware of putting all your eggs into the stock market basket. Although financial consultants repeatedly warn investors to be prudent, rising stocks prompt reckless speculation. Han Jingrun, a 31-year-old employee at a British software company, resigned earlier this year in order to give himself time to do research prior to buying and selling stock. “As I had insufficient time to devote to stock market dealings, my profits were mediocre. I can now stay at home and concentrate on my portfolios instead of stealing the time to check on stock market trends.” Han Jingrun has invested his total capital-about RMB 150,000-in stock, and is one of many. “As online trade is so convenient, there are few, other than more senior citizens, that feel the need to go personally to the stock exchange,” says Han. Many stock exchange veterans, for example Han's father, having survived the long bearish market, are now raring to go for more active dealing.“We have no channels for our surplus cash other than real estate and the stock market. When the government took a stricter stance on real estate, capital flowed into the other alternative -- the attractive stock market of 2006,” says Peng Bo, who works at a securities analysis company. But for rookie investors, risk has no meaning; they believe themselves immune to failure until they actually lose.Yang Shen (a pseudonym) is well known through Tianya.cn, an integrated online forum, where he pastes his stock prediction for the next day or week.

The Shanghai composite index has risen from 1,161 point to a record 3,000 since the beginning of 2006. This phenomenal increase has reaffirmed general belief that input will bring profit. Financial Education Essential“We have few choices,” says securities manager Peng Bo. “If government control over the stock market tightens, capital will have nowhere to go but back into real estate or fixed deposits, which means that the property market will continue to overheat. Many investors fantasize about getting rich overnight through real estate or stock market windfalls. Realistic guidelines on money management need to be instituted in order to dispel investment’s gambling ethos.” Financial management products designed by banks and insurance companies are popular with investors content to make slow, steady profits. An investigation carried out by Shanghai Shenzhou Market Surveys reveals that a full 86.4 percent of respondents thought that “money management is synonymous with a positive life style and attitude”, while 80.3 percent believe that “private money management should be personalized”. Of those interviewed, 71.3 percent had funds in fixed deposits and 33 percent had investments in stocks and shares. Experts confirm that fixed deposits are still the first choice in China, at least until the social security system is perfected. The next big wave of change will occur when a system of social security has been fully formulated and traditional concepts accordingly adapt. Until then, stocks and shares are it for Chinese citizens with cash to spare.

He's tapping money and power to change that. It was 1993 and China was bidding for the 2000 Olympics. with the country brimming with confidence, a Chinese-born Harvard mathematician figured this was the time to ask China to host another global event held every four years. Shing-Tung Yau and his longtime mentor, another Chinese mathematician, won a meeting with then President Jiang Zemin, so he flew in from the U.S. They proposed that Beijing host the International Congress of Mathematicians, the largest conference in the math world. If China could spend billions on games that would showcase the best athletes, they argued, it could easily afford a conclave that would highlight the best mathematical brains. They were talking to a former engineer. Jiang was sold.Yau has long been on a mission: to boost what he sees as the low level of mathematics in China and raise the profile of Chinese mathematicians. The congress didn't come to Beijing until 2002 (and China lost its first Olympics bid, though the games will arrive next year). But Jiang's approval and the accompanying media splash helped Yau tap wealthy moguls for the centerpiece of his efforts: building three advanced mathematics institutes. "I want to train the next-generation leaders of China in math," he says. "I don't believe any modern society can be built where the general public doesn't have a decent knowledge of math."A master of networking and fundraising, Yau constantly works his Rolodex to keep the money flowing and to persuade the best Chinese math minds from around the world to sign on as associates of his institutes. A big attraction is the 57-year-old Yau himself: He's the leading Chinese mathematician and ranks among the top ten in the world, says Phillip Griffiths, a math professor and a former president of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.To Westerners who see China's math students regularly ranking near the top in international comparisons and Chinese mathematicians populating the math faculties at the finest overseas universities, Yau's crusade seems like overkill. But he says that at the highest levels, mathematicians in China are far behind their Western counterparts: "Most Chinese still use technology from America. I want them to create their own research so they don't rely on others and don't copy."One reason is that for decades China sent its best math students abroad. Most find a welcoming environment to do research--or get lucrative jobs in the private sector--and never return. This brain drain is a big hurdle for creating a corps of world-class math wizards in China. "For China to become a society built on technology, it needs a solid background, and math is the basic language for that," says Yau. "Physics, software, engineering, banking, insurance--all of these depend on math research."So Yau founded the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1993 and serves as the director. He also started the Morningside Center of Mathematics in Beijing in 1995 and the Center of Mathematical Science in Zhejiang University in Hangzhou--100 miles southwest of Shanghai and one of China's oldest universities--in 2002. For his day job he's been a professor at Harvard for 20 years, specializing in geometry, differential equations and mathematical physics. A U.S. citizen, Yau won a Fields Medal (the equivalent in mathematics of a Nobel Prize) in 1982, a MacArthur "genius grant" in 1985 and the U.S. President's National Medal of Science in 1997."Yau is like God in China," says Tony Chan, the assistant director for mathematics and physical sciences at the National Science Foundation outside Washington, D.C. and a visiting professor at the Hong Kong institute. "He goes to China and he can see the premier. In the U.S. even the director of the NSF cannot see President Bush."But in the past year Yau has gotten into two very public spats. One was with Beijing University, which he accused of corruption. The other was with the New Yorker magazine, which in August portrayed him in an article as trying to steal credit for solving the Poincaré conjecture, a 103-year-old math problem considered the holy grail of geometry and topology. He says the charge is completely false; other news outlets looking into the issue found evidence to back him up.Situated in a corner of a lush 330-acre college campus in the New Territories and occupying three floors of the simply named Academic Building No. 1, Yau's Hong Kong institute started slowly. "In Hong Kong most rich men [who give money to schools] want a building named after them," says Yau. "But we didn't even have a building."An undergraduate at Harvard led Yau to his first big donor, one who didn't ask for naming rights and declined an honorary degree. That donor was the student's father, Malaysian billionaire (but Hong Kong resident) Robert Kuok. He gave $6 million that started an endowment and attracted the institute's first full-time faculty member in 1998, a professor from New York University. Then Kuok introduced Yau to his friend, and Asia's richest resident, Li Ka-shing, who donated $1.3 million. Ronnie Chan, a Hong Kong real estate tycoon who had known Yau since his days teaching at Stanford University in the 1970s, introduced him to his uncle, Thomas Chen, who dished out another $1.3 million.A crucial $2 million donation came from William Mong, owner of Shun Hing Electronic Holdings in Hong Kong, a leading distributor for Panasonic since the 1950s. Sitting in a gilded conference room at his company's headquarters in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood, Mong recalls the difficulties of attending school as a teenager in rural China during the Japanese invasion, when he occasionally had to dodge bombs. But "once I became an agent for Panasonic in 1953, I saw Japan's technological advancement and I was very impressed," he says. "It made me wish we had more capable engineers in Hong Kong and China, and that's my aim now." The money helped to endow a chair and hire another permanent faculty member.Today the institute gets 100 applicants from China and elsewhere in Asia for each class of 20 in its five-year masters-and-Ph.D. program. One attraction is programs that collaborate with the engineering and physics departments on topics such as betting on horse races, creating 3-D images of people and predicting the weather. Another draw is an impressive array of visiting faculty from China, Japan, North America and Europe. "I can't get these people to come to China," says Ronnie Chan. "But Shing-Tung Yau can."For the Morningside Center in Beijing, Yau got help from the Chinese government and Ronnie and his brother, Gerald. (Gerald and Yau had been friends since their future wives were roommates in San Francisco in the late 1960s.) The government donated a plot, and the brothers put up the money for a building the center shares with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It trains 250 researchers a year in six-month-long sessions. Now, in a bid to take on research institutes abroad, it offers an award that it hopes will someday rival the Fields Medal. Most of its graduates are working in universities across China. "I hope these students will have an influence on the future of China," Yau says.A native of Guangdong province and one of eight children, Yau fled China with his family after the Communists took over in 1949. Growing up without electricity and running water in a village near the Chinese University of Hong Kong--where his dad was a professor--he was more interested in hanging out with his friends and skipping school than in learning arithmetic. But when he was 14 his father died and he became serious about his studies. He enrolled in Chinese University and in 1969 moved on to graduate school at University of California, Berkeley. There he met his mentor, the late Shiing-Shen Chern, regarded as one of the greatest geometry experts of the 20th century. It was Chern who traveled with Yau for their meeting with Jiang in 1993. In 1971 and just 22, Yau earned his Ph.D.Next to his math talent, the most remarkable thing about Yau, his colleagues agree, is his ability to collect money. "Yau knows how to sell," says Peter Li, a math professor at UC, Irvine. "He is relentless in his pursuit, like a car salesman." Yau says he is very practical about it, although his friends say a better term is "too direct." "Normally you have to go to ten dinners with these rich people before you can ask about a donation," says Yau. "But I don't have that kind of time, so I ask after the first dinner." He tells potential donors: "Money is nothing. It's all about your legacy." Over breakfast at a Howard Johnson motel he once persuaded a Chinese engineer living in New Jersey to donate $2 million to the math center at Zhejiang.And maybe it's this bluntness that got him into trouble with Beijing University--which he accused of inflating the value of its research--and the New Yorker. "He's a very forceful personality, and in academia they may not be used to a bulldozer of a guy," says a friend of Yau's. The magazine alleged that Yau was taking credit for solving the Poincaré conjecture away from a Russian mathematician, Grigory Perelman. Yau is demanding an apology, but the magazine issued a statement saying it stands by its story. "That article was a misunderstanding of the culture of mathematics and a misunderstanding of Chinese culture," he says. Perelman posted the answer online, but didn't show how he solved it. That set off several teams trying to duplicate his work while also fully outlining the process, as required by academic journals. Two of Yau's students, spurred by Yau, won this race in 2006.Yau is an impatient man. Sitting in his office at Harvard Square, he answers e-mails while chatting with a visitor. "There is a fear in the news media that China is rising," he says. "But it's better to create understanding between cultures, and math is a common language for that." His vision, he says, is to make his Hong Kong institute--his only one that awards doctorates--the Harvard of Hong Kong. "It took Harvard a few hundred years to be built. Hopefully, it won't take us as much time. We just need enough funding."

2006 Brilliance              By ZUO YOUQIANG http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e2007/e200708/p40.htmThe year 2006 marked a watershed in China’s auto industry - courtesy of Brilliance Autos, star of Northeast China’s industrial base. It was in 2006 that Splendor, the new high quality engine from the Brilliance workshop, immediately won the hearts of China’s auto enthusiasts upon its public unveiling. The Splendor model is China’s first turbo-charged 1.8-litre gasoline engine. Brilliance stands out among other Chinese auto manufacturers for its production of cars whose engines, as well as exteriors, are domestically manufactured. It was also in 2006 that 3,000 of the Brilliance Zhonghua models were exported to Germany, and that Brilliance Jinbei Automobiles Co. Ltd was named one of the National Key Enterprises of Auto Exporting. Brilliance sales in the first three quarters of 2006 hit 151,200, putting it at a number nine ranking among China’s automakers. Brilliance also generated RMB 1.5 billion on the Hong Kong stock market.Government SupportThe hopes of Liaoning province, originally China’s main center of heavy industry, as well as its 350,000 employees were pinned on Brilliance. The company owes much of its success to government resources and information.The vice provincial governor of Liaoning responsible for economy headed a delegation to the Brilliance offices in May 2005. After thorough research and investigation, the team initiated a series of measures to remedy difficulties that Brilliance had been experiencing. Qi Yumin, former deputy mayor of Dalian and also an experienced manager, was appointed as chairman of a new board of management at the end of 2005. This was a turning point for Brilliance.The Market RulesIn a calculated strategy to cultivate the market, Brilliance slashed the price of its Zunchi model, formerly the Zhonghua, in January 2006. The wisdom of this move was manifest in a complete sell-out of Zunchi stock. It was in March 2006 that Splendor charmed the market with its elegant exterior, comfortable interior furnishing and solid safety features. Designed for family use, its price was set at a relatively low RMB 100 thousand. Within five months, orders had been placed for 40,000 units.Brilliance has been shrewd in its handling of the market. Its production capacity is geared towards output, its output to sales, its sales to profits and profits to competitive strength. Quality the FoundationJune 2006 saw the unveiling of the first turbo-charged 1.8-litre gasoline engine ever produced in China. Its internationally-advanced turbo charging and intercooler technology meets the Euro IV Emissions Requirement, and its endurance level is double that specified by the national standard. Peter Schippl, vice president of BMW-Brilliance held an administration board meeting of Brilliance Auto in September 2006. Schippl, who has worked in the automobile spare parts industry for five years, in an engine manufacturing facility for eight years, and who has been with BMW for 29 years, is the appointed Quality Control Manager at Brilliance Auto.Challenges and StrategiesDespite the tremendous progress achieved in 2006, Brilliance’s new decision maker faces many challenges -- those of inadequate research and development, low profitability and market share, and deep-rooted problems in the company structure, system and technologies. China plans to boost its market share in domestic auto brands to 60 percent by 2010. Brilliance has formulated a two-step strategy towards establishing the largest auto base in China, and possibly in Asia, with an independent research and development section. The first step is to emerge from its two-year deficit. In 2007, annual sales are expected to reach 280,000, up from 122,500 in 2005; and sales proceeds to hit RMB 40 billion, as compared to RMB 20 billion in 2005. By 2010, sales should increase to 500,000 and revenue to RMB 80 billion, doubling the 2005 figures. Address: 24 Baiwanzhuang Road, Beijing 100037 ChinaFax: 86-010-68328338Website: http://www.chinatoday.com.cnE-mail: chinatoday@chinatoday.com.cnCopyright (C) China Today, All Rights Reserved.

Impact of Rising Rent The incidence of Tai Cheong's demise aroused public concern towards the rising rent phenomenon. In view of that, the QTSA conducted a survey in mid June in which members were interviewed to investigate the magnitude of the rental increase and the impact of such rental fears to the retail industry. A total of 541 members were successfully interviewed, the response rate is 50.6%. From these, 75% came from retail sector and the other 25% were from the catering sector.  Of those interviewed, around 80% of the respondents were tenants - over 50% of whom were affected by the rent rise, with an increase of around 10% to 50%. However 30% of the affected tenants were suffering from a rent increase of 50% above, and some even saw rise of up to 300%. They mainly located in high traffic areas such as Causeway Bay, Central, Mongkok, Tsim Sha Tsui, Wan Chai etc.  When facing the hefty rents, around 45% of the affected tenants chose to relocate their shops to areas with lower rent and reduce the operation expenses other than staffing. The rest chose to react by taking action related to existing operations, for example, around 17% of them will increase price and another 15% will trim down the number of outlets. The remaining 13% will cut down staff costs and increase product varieties and service quality etc. in order to defuse this negative situation.  Of the tenants affected, 60% tried to negotiate with their landlords but they did not come to an agreement and the landlords refused to change their initial rate.  http://www.qtsa.com/industry/industry.php

Semitism: [ 'semitizəm ]  n. 闪族人特质, 性格JPost.com » Magazine » Lifestyle » Article  Jan 17, 2008 9:54 | Updated Jan 20, 2008 19:10 Great expectationsBy MEIR RONNEN  A wonderful new hardcover book Power to the People, edited by Alex Ward, curator of the Design Pavilion of the Israel Museum, is actually a fully illustrated catalog to the stunning exhibition of early Soviet posters he mounted at the museum in 1994. It could have been entitled "Great Expectations." From an early Soviet poster series on foreign intervention, circa 1921 "They would gobble up us workers like pork chops dinner."Back in 1920-21, when these early posters were made, all was hope and optimism in war-ravaged Russia. Lenin had signed a separate peace with Germany. The bloody Russian civil war, Reds against czarist Whites, was pretty much over (the victorious Red Army was led by a Jew, Leon Trotsky, who was later exiled and then murdered on Stalin's orders). Artists of all types were at first delighted supporters of the Bolsheviks. In the brief period now known as Heroic Communism, large numbers of artists got together to discuss collective goals (the word collective would soon become one of the most feared in Russia). Anyone with some sort of an education or training could find a niche in the new system. In a new world, there was to be room for the newest in the arts. There were volunteers for poorly paid and even unpaid jobs. The artists and writers (and soon filmmakers) became willing agitators in a nationwide propaganda campaign. Agitprop became the new buzzword. Agitprop trains decorated with communist slogans and flags carried the word - and films - to the front and villages near the rail lines. Agitprop floats filled the streets along with revolutionary street theaters; and Agitprop boats sailed down the Volga. One of the early Agitprop enthusiasts was the Georgian-born Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893-1930), who came to Moscow with his family in 1906 and even as a young teenager got himself arrested by the czarist police. Mayakovsky, in his first call to the "Army of Art," exhorted artists to go out into the streets because "the streets are our brushes, the squares our palettes." In 1920, he threw himself into the ROSTA posters project. ROSTA was the acronym of the newly formed Russian Telegraphic Agency, which published daily bulletins, not just news but also new decrees and more importantly, the rules and requirements of social projects, like mass vaccinations against smallpox. One poster reads: Beware your fate, those who do not inoculate!So rush to the stationFor your smallpox vaccination. Only a fifth of the Russian proletariat was literate, but not in literary Russian. The messages of the posters were condensed to simple rhyming couplets in spoken street Russian, printed below flat but striking images. Most were written by Mayakovsky, who also drew or designed many of the images. A graphic form of didactic comic strips, the daily ROSTA posters were produced overnight by teams of writers, artists and stencilers. The images were printed in editions of around 200 on available small-format newsprint, the most that could be made from a stencil. Each poster was pasted onto a large sheet of backing paper in the correct order, much like a comic-strip message, and posted at railway stations and kiosks, but mostly in places protected from the elements, like store windows, which anyway had nothing else to display. About 1,600 series of these stenciled posters were produced, some within an hour or two of receiving a report. Speed and the medium dictated the aesthetic nature of the results: Each image was highly formalized, as in a cartoon. A separate stencil had to be cut for each color, and the pigments were brushed on by hand. The solutions are ingenious and fascinating in their bravura simplicity; their character derives from cutting rather than drawing. The stenciled lettering served as the key to the register. The stencil method was peculiar to Moscow; in Petrograd the ROSTA posters were printed by lithography, while in Odessa, where paper was unavailable, the posters were painted onto plywood and later painted over as the wood was recycled for the next edition. News was flashed by Morse telegraphy. In Moscow, Mayakovsky's talents and energy made him the dominant poster production figure, although unlike his artists, Mikhail Cheremnykh (1890-1962) and Ivan Malyutin (1889-1932), he had no official position. After ROSTA, Mayakovsky, together with the famous Constructivist Aleksandr Rodchenko, a noted designer, painter and photographer, wrote and designed advertisements promoting nationalized industries. In 1923, Mayakovsky organized the Left Front of the Arts in an attempt to ward off the socialist-realist demands of Lenin's yes-men. In 1930, disillusioned with communism and disappointed in love, he took his own life. In Russia, he remains a legend. Cheremnykh, a trained artist and skilled political cartoonist, was one of the founders of Krokodil, the Soviet satirical magazine which survived for over four decades, as did the brilliant Cheremnykh. Malyutin, an equally accomplished artist, drew the first cover of Krokodil and worked for other satirical journals. All looked back on their ROSTA poster days as the most exciting time of their lives. The ROSTA posters told Russians how to sort and store their potatoes and called on peasants to pay their taxes to help those whose crops had failed. There is no hint of anti-Semitism in any of these posters and the capitalists do not look like Jews. Mayakovsky's messages are however, unabashedly racist. He attacks the Poles, Slovaks and Czechs as well as the Entente: The Entente has not given up the fight They are trying to incite Poland, Romania and other small fry. Under a series of drawings by Malyutin he tells Red soldiers to look after their equipment: Keep the barracks spotless and your riflecleanOf your coat take good careLook after your footwear.Later, Mayakovsky describes to the hard-pressed workers and peasants around Moscow the famine in the Volga region: So the coming anniversary celebrationWill not be marked with a decorousdemonstration.To mark our holiday, we'll the faminedefeatAnd give those on the Volga somethingto eat. In October 1921, Mayakovsky drew and wrote his last 12-poster series. In several he wrote: From an early Soviet poster series on foreign intervention, circa 1921 "They would gobble up us workers like pork chops dinner."The Red platoons came home and foundfactories and plants all wrecked to thegroundIn order to save our energy and not failLet's first repair industry of the largestscale.Everyone here must think this overWhile our hearts rejoice for theRevolution of October. He was as free with promises as the party hacks: Delegate the best of your comradesand send them to the army trainingcourses.As to their families, the trainees canbe at easeThe Republic will see to all their needs. These ostensibly good-natured posters sometimes contain barely veiled threats against tax dodgers, but in general they mask the tragedy of those who believed in the Revolution. This historic record was generously presented to the museum by collector Merrill C. Berman. It contains more than 600 individual posters from 64 different series. The vast numbers reproduced in the catalog necessitated reducing most of them to the size of large postage stamps. The original exhibition was given an unusual design by architect Michael Fieldmann. http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&cid=1200475901236&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull

doppler: [ 'dɔplə ]  n. 多普勒效应doppler:1. Austrian physicist famous for his discovery of the Doppler effect (1803-1853)同义词：Christian Johann DopplerThe Doppler effect, named after Christian Doppler, is the change in frequency and wavelength of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium. Each of these effects is analysed separately. For waves which do not require a medium, such as light or gravity in special relativity, only the relative difference in velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered.
