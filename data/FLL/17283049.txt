Recovery for Britain's battered economy will take years to come says glum PM David Cameron By James Chapman and Sean PoulterLast updated at 1:19 AM on 28th January 2011David Cameron will warn today it will take several ‘tough’ years to repair Britain’s battered economy – as figures show the biggest slump in consumer confidence for almost 20 years.In his starkest warning yet on the ‘immense’ challenge facing Britain, the Prime Minister will insist there is no way to ‘flick on the switch of Government spending or pump the bubble back up’.Labour’s economy was built on the worst deficit in the developed world, the riskiest bank lending, the most indebted households, the biggest housing boom and ‘unsustainable’ levels of public spending and immigration, Mr Cameron willsay.Creating a new economy based on savings and investment rather than debt and private sector entrepreneurs rather than a bloated public sector is the work of a generation, he will tell the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The remarks will be seen as an indication that Mr Cameron believes he will need two terms in power to successfully rebalance the economy. ‘It’s going to be tough – but we must see it through,’ he will say. Chancellor George Osborne, also speaking at the event, will attack the ‘forces of stagnation’ resisting public spending cuts and pro-business reforms of regulation, planning and Echoing Mr Cameron, he will warn: ‘Building a new model of growth will not be easy – if it was, then we wouldn’t have been tempted down the path of easy money in the first place.’The remarks appear to indicate a shift in emphasis for the Government, which has claimed in recent months to have taken Britain out of the economic ‘danger zone’ and focused on the potential for growth.Figures this week showing a plunge in the economy in the last three months of last year have raised fears of a possible double dip recession and prompted ministers to remind voters they are in for a long haul.A report today shows an eight-point fall in consumer confidence last month, the biggest since the slump of the 1990s.Nick Moon, of GfK NOP Social Research, said: ‘In the 35 years since the index began, confidence has only slumped this much on six occasions, the last being in the midst of the 1992 recession. ‘The VAT increase is the first of the Government’s austerity measures that has had a widespread impact on consumers, and it seems to have hit people’s economic confidence hard, especially as the biggest drop was in consumers’ appetite for major purchases. ‘With inflation on the up and the full force of the cuts yet to hit, these figures could be the beginning of a very painful period.’A second study on spending power showed families are suffering a bigger attack on living standards than during the 2008 recession. Higher fuel, energy and food bills are causing real hardship, triggering a sharp fall in high street spending, particularly on so-called big ticket items, such as furniture. The survey from the Centre for Economics and Business Research and Asda found families were around £8 a week worse off in December than a year ago. Mr Cameron will insist the Coalition will not be diverted from its deficit reduction measures. ‘Our first priority is to kill off the spectre of massive sovereign debts. Those who argue that dealing with our deficit and promoting growth are somehow alternatives are wrong,’ he will say.‘You cannot put off the first in order to promote the second. Some countries are again borrowing five, six or seven per cent of GDP again this year. The figure for the UK is more than ten per cent. This is clearly unsustainable and action cannot be put off.’Labour’s treasury spokesman Angela Eagle, said: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne complacently boasted last month that the economy was recovering and Britain was out of the danger zone. But in the real world it’s becoming increasingly clear the Conservative-led government is making the wrong choices on the economy.‘Cutting too deep, too fast is not the best way to get the deficit down.’Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1351292/Recovery-Britains-battered-economy-years-come-says-glum-PM-David-Cameron.html#ixzz1CJbA4I21

Crackdown on disabled badge cheats: How abuse of parking permits could be cheating taxpayer out of £46m a yearBy James ChapmanLast updated at 9:10 AM on 14th February 2011Disabled drivers will face tough medical tests before they get blue badge parking permits after evidence emerged of widespread fraud and abuse.Some 2.5million currently qualify for the badges, which allow free parking in pay-and-display bays, at meters and on single- and double-yellow lines.But research suggests around half of users are not entitled to the badges and as a result the taxpayer is being cheated out of up to £46million a year. Now the Government is planning measures to tackle the problem.Many councils have been issuing permits without any medical checks and solely on the basis of an application letter. Incredibly, 16,535 badges have been identified as still being used despite the fact that their registered holders have died.Other forms of abuse include genuinely disabled people allowing carers to use a badge, and drivers fraudulently applying to more than one council.Badges are also often tampered with to alter the expiry date. Abuse has become so widespread that blue badges obtained fraudulently are circulating on the black market for up to £1,500.More...Bosses employing disabled workers snub plea by IDS to cap their salaries... and hand themselves £1.5m BONUS Nick Clegg ‘out to wreck Big Society’ as David Cameron tries to salvage flagship policy The number of badges in use has soared in recent years. In England, 48 badges are issued per 1,000 people, compared with 37 per 1,000 people ten years ago.The annual value of benefits to holders is estimated to be more than £100 per badge.Under Government plans due to be announced this week, councils will be given new powers to impose checks on applicants similar to those undergone by those claiming disability benefits. Ministers are expected to announce a new design that will make the badges more difficult to forge.They will also say that the price of a badge will increase from £2 to £10. They last for up to three years and this is the first price rise since 1983.A Government source said: ‘This change will be caricatured as government cuts taken to new heights – but we really need to clamp down on those who abuse the regime.’Transport Minister Norman Baker said the genuinely needy were being hit by the abuse of the system. ‘Such are the high levels of fraud in the current system that 50 per cent of blue badge holders now find it difficult to get a parking space,’ he said. Those who use badges fraudulently can face a fine of up to £1,000, but few offenders are caught.Places: United Kingdom http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1356608/Abuse-disabled-parking-permits-cheating-taxpayer-46m-year.html#

Stakeholder PensionsA Stakeholder Pension is a low cost pension that has to adhere to government rules on charges, access and terms, offering complete simplicity and transparency.Pension SchemeA pension scheme is a Pension arrangement that is usually arranged by a company for the benefit of the employees.Pension FundsA pension fund is a pool of assets bought with contributions to a pension plan by individuals who are investing finance with the intention of creating a retirement income.Work PensionsA work pension or company pension is a pension that you accumulate during your working life in conjunction with your employer. Working pension schemes usually require you to make regular pension contributions based on a percentage of your salary and the employer will in most cases match the level of contribution that you make. State PensionsA State Pension also know as a Government Pension or Old Age Pension is a pension that is accumulated during an individuals lifetime and paid, by the government when they reach state pension or retirement age. A state pension value is based on the individual's National Insurance contributions (NI) made throughout his or her working life.Pension ReleaseA pension release plan, sometimes called pension unlocking, enables an individual to release money from my pension plan and in particular release cash from my pension plan in a much more flexible way than the standard Annuity. For example if you are looking for early pension release then the individual member can immediately release funds from my pension and gain access to the tax-free lump sum of up to 25% of the value of their overall pension release fund without the need to take regular income. The balance of the pensions release funds within the pension are then invested into a managed portfolio from which you are then able to draw income from the pension investment. Pension Release is a very specialist product and you should always seek pensions release advice or pension release help from an Independent Advisor.Pensions TaxPension tax is the rate of tax payable on a pension annuity income, usually deducted by the annuity provider before payment of the net annuity amount.Self Invested Personal PensionA SIPP or Self Invested Personal Pension is a type of personal pension scheme which gives individuals control over the investment decisions that control how their funds are invested. Self Invested Personal Pension schemes carry the same limits and restrictions as regular Personal Pensions but traditionally, because of relatively high flat-fee charging structures, they have often only been suitable for individuals with fairly large pension funds. However SIPPs with lower fees have recently been introduced which have made them available to a wider range of people.Private PensionA private pension is a pension that an individual arranges on their own behalf and is not connected in anyway to the individuals employer. Retirement incomes offered by private pensions will vary from provider to provider and are wholly dependant on the investment choices of the individual, the investment performance of the funds, the level of contributions made by the individual and the level of charges applied by the provider. How to find the Best Pension for YouTo find the best pension for you ensure that you shop around. Each pension company will vary in both charges and investment performance so it is important that you get the right pension for you requirements. You should try and compare the market to get a good comparison rather than just accept the initial pension advice you receive.http://mailcompare.mailonline.co.uk/pensions

PawnshopsSmall- and medium-sized firms are turning to pawnshops for quick and easier money-borrowing services.Small, mid-sized companies turn to pawnshops for loans(China Daily)Updated: 2011-02-16 10:00BEIJING - Small- and medium-sized companies in China are turning to pawnshops for quick and easier money-borrowing services, even at much higher costs, as they are finding it difficult to get bank loans due to tight lending policies.The central bank's move to raise the benchmark interest rate made it harder for the small- and medium-sized companies to borrow money from banks, and this is providing a boost for the pawnshops, Han Li, a legal adviser from Beijing Pawn Trade Association, told China Daily.Many small- and medium-sized companies pledge cars as well as real estate, including offices, shops and factories, to resolve short-term cash-flow problems."The cost for pawning privately owned houses is 3.2 percent of the amount borrowed for each contract period, and for companies' real estate can be a maximum of 4 percent in our pawnshop," said Huang Ronghua, a manager from the real estate business center of Baoruitong Pawnshop, a major chain in Beijing. The regular period for a pawn contract is 30 days.In Huaxia Pawnshop, borrowers pay at the rate of 3.2 percent for both privately owned and company-owned real estate for each period. The rate for pledging cars is as high as 4.5 percent.The People's Bank of China (PBOC) raised the one-year benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points and adjusted the one-year loan rate to 6.06 percent on Feb 8.That means that the bank loan rate for a month is only about 0.5 percent, while the borrowing cost from pawnshops is about six times higher.Usually companies can get money in less than three days after they provide property-ownership certificates to pawnshops. For car pawning, it is less than 12 hours. faster than the bank's credit assessment procedures."Lending money to small- and medium-sized companies has become the major business of our pawnshop, and the deal volumes are much higher than personal products pawn over the past few months," said Chen Yuan, manager of the Marketing Department of Baoruitong Pawnshop.According to Han, the legal adviser, the money that pawnshops lend comes from bank loans and their own funds, and the amounted loaned should not exceed the pawnbroker's registered capital. Therefore, pawnshops earn a good margin from their business.Some banks, including the China Agricultural Bank and the Bank of Beijing, are the cooperative business partners of Baoruitong Pawnshop. Huaxia Pawnshop is in partnership with banks including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Hua Xia Bank."Without professional risk-management systems, pawnbrokers in China have higher risks than banks. Pawnshops should improve risk-management capabilities to provide better financial services to small- and medium-sized companies," Han added.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2011-02/16/content_12023880.htm

Ten principles for a black swan robust worldTaleb enumerates ten principles for building systems that are robust to Black Swan Events: 1.	What is fragile should break early while it is still small. Nothing should ever become Too Big to Fail. 2.	No socialisation of losses and privatisation of gains. 3.	People who were driving a school bus blindfolded (and crashed it) should never be given a new bus. 4.	Do not let someone making an "incentive" bonus manage a nuclear plant – or your financial risks. 5.	Counter-balance complexity with simplicity. 6.	Do not give children sticks of dynamite, even if they come with a warning. 7.	Only Ponzi schemes should depend on confidence. Governments should never need to "restore confidence". 8.	Do not give an addict more drugs if he has withdrawal pains. 9.	Citizens should not depend on financial assets or fallible "expert" advice for their retirement. 10.	Make an omelette with the broken eggs. Taleb also recommends employing both physical and functional redundancy in the design of systems. These two steps can be found in the principles of resilience architecting. (Reference: Jackson, S. Architecting Resilient Systems: John Wiley & Sons. Hoboken, NJ: 2010.)

We must not repeat mistakes of the Great Depression, warns Mervyn KingBy HUGO DUNCANLast updated at 9:30 PM on 18th February 2011The world is at risk of a return to 1930s-style protectionism that would have ruinous consequences for the global economy, the head of the Bank of England warned last night.Governor Mervyn King said a repeat of the policies that exacerbated the Great Depression would sow the seeds of the next financial crisis and recession.He said all the main players were ‘pursuing their own self-interest’ and called for ‘a grand bargain’ to prevent a fresh global disaster.A global currency war has broken out with countries battling to devalue their exchange rates to boost exports and drive economic growth.The U.S. and China, the world’s two biggest economies, are at loggerheads over Beijing’s refusal to let its currency strengthen. Washington claims it gives China an unfair advantage.It is feared that it could lead to a full-blown trade war with governments imposing tariffs on imports in a desperate effort to protect their own manufacturers.Mr King told a meeting of central bankers in Paris that the threat of trade protectionism ‘still lurks’ in the global economy and new rules may be needed to fight it.‘The need to act in the collective interest has yet to be recognised, and unless it is it will only be a matter of time before one or more countries resort to protectionism,’ he said.‘That could, as it did in the 1930s, lead to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world. Every country would suffer ruinous consequences. What is needed is a grand bargain among the major players in the world. A bargain that recognises the benefits of compromise in order to avoid the damaging consequences of a move towards protectionism.‘If we, collectively, do not deal with these problems, at best we will have a weak world recovery and at worst we will sow the seeds of the next financial crisis.’Central bankers and finance ministers from the G20 group of leading nations are meeting in Paris this weekend to thrash out how to solve problems in the world economy.However, there is little agreement on what to do about issues such as the soaring price of key goods including food and fuel.Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1358483/Mervyn-King-warns-repeat-mistakes-Great-Depression.html#ixzz1ESn3rHmA

17 February 2011 Last updated at 12:54 GMT Share this pageFacebookTwitterShareEmailPrint Q&A: Universal Credit and the benefits overhaul By Kevin Peachey Personal finance reporter, BBC News The government has published a Welfare Reform Bill which is set to mark the biggest overhaul of the benefits system since the 1940s. Work Secretary Iain Duncan Smith plans to bring in a single Universal Credit to replace six income-related work-based benefits. But why plan for such a move and what does it mean for you? What is the idea behind this? Mr Duncan Smith argues that millions of people have become trapped on benefits. At present, in nearly 1.1 million workless households, a person will currently lose more than 70% of their earnings if they move into work of 10 hours a week, the government claims. It wants to see a system where people are always better off in work than they would be on benefits. What is the issue with the system at present? Perhaps the biggest issue is how complicated it has become. There are more than 50 different benefits and other payments that people can claim. Such complexity causes confusion, according to the government. In 2009, 2.3 million contacts to the Department for Work and Pensions were driven by people contacting the wrong agency and 1.4 million by people contacting the wrong office, it said. It estimates that £5.2bn a year is wrongly paid out as a result of fraud and error. So simplification is also the aim of the game, by merging income-related jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit, working tax credit, income support and income-related employment support allowance - into a single universal payment. There was debate and discussion as to whether carer's allowance should be merged into the Universal Credit payment, but this has now been ruled out. Who are the winners and losers? The government estimates that about 2.7 million households will have higher entitlements as a result of Universal Credit, with more than one million households seeing an increase in entitlements of more than £25 a week. Nobody will see their benefits entitlement fall at the point of transition to the new system, because their Universal Credit will be fixed. In the longer-term approximately 1.7 million households will have notional lower entitlements than they otherwise would have done. In time, these people will not see their Universal Credit entitlement increased each year in line with inflation, known as uprating. However, the government argues that all are winners because working extra hours will never reduce people's income from work and benefits. Poverty will also be cut, it says. When will this happen? It will start for new claimants in October 2013, with people migrating over from existing benefits during the following four years. However, if given the go-ahead by Parliament, it could take 10 years to come into effect fully. What else is on the agenda? There will be stricter rules for people losing their benefits if they refuse a job, under the plans. A sliding scale of sanctions will see benefits withdrawn for three years if three jobs are refused in three years. This will generally see those who refuse work on one occasion in 12 months having their benefits taken away for three months. If they refuse a second job within the next 12 months, benefits will be taken away for six months. If they refuse a third job in the next 12 months, their benefits will be taken away for three years. The government plans to replace Disability Living Allowance with the Personal Independence Payment from 2013. This tax-free benefit is paid to 3.2 million disabled people, including children, who have difficulty walking and need somebody to help look after them. Instead of some disabilities leading to a guaranteed entitlement, claimants will have to go through regular assessments on how their condition affects them. The government has also confirmed plans to implement a £50 immediate fine for "errors that could have reasonably been prevented" on benefit claims. It also wants to impose tougher penalties for more serious benefit fraud. Is everyone in favour? Labour says that it would welcome simplification of the system but suggests that there are not the jobs available to ensure people get into work. Some unions have also spoken out, with the Unite union claiming it creates a division between a "deserving" and an "undeserving poor" - a division that it does not recognise. Concerns have also been raised that the Universal Credit would normally be claimed online, as many thousands of low income families do not have access to the internet. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11735673 1.

China calls for more US transparency BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhuanet) -- China hopes the United States will make the approval process forChinese enterprises seeking to invest in the US more transparent, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said Thursday. 　　Yao Jian, the ministry spokesman, made the remarks during a news briefing when a question was raised about Huawei Technologies Co's troubled bid to acquire US server technology firm 3Leaf Systems last year. 　　The comments are the first official response from the ministry concerning Huawei's purchase of 3Leaf for 2 million U.S. dollarslast May. 　　Citing "security concerns," the US government rejected several previous bids by Chinese companies to acquire US firms, such as Huawei's attempt to purchase US technology firm 3Com in 2008, and Northwest Nonferrous International Investment Co's bid for mining company First Gold in 2009, Yao said. 　　"Those obstructions and interruptions impact cooperation between China and the US to some extent," said Yao. 　　In May 2010, when Huawei purchased the assets of 3Leaf Systems, the company initially failed to disclose the deal because it did not think it was necessary, because it only purchased some of 3Leaf's assets, like intellectual property rights. 　　However, in November of last year, the Pentagon retroactively requested a review of the acquisition by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). 　　According to the Associated Press, a group of US lawmakers appealed to both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke in a letter last week, asking the officials to examine the 3Leaf deal closely. 　　The lawmakers are concerned the Huawei deal could transfer sensitive technology to China. 　　On February 11, the Committee on Foreign Investment suggested Huawei cancel the deal with 3Leaf, but Huawei refused, saying it would await a final decision from US President Obama. 　　In an email reply to the Global Times, the world's No. 3 seller of telecom network equipment said it will still stick to its business in the US, no matter what the final decision will be, while continuing to cooperate with the US government. 　　"Huawei has faced many obstacles in the US," Yao said. "We hope the US security laws and regulations can treat Chinese companies fairly, whether they are a listed firm, a State-owned enterprise or a private company." 　　Last Saturday, the State Council said it would review merger and acquisition (M&A) deals that involve foreign firms to ensure they do not endanger China's national security, 　　Yao said on Thursday that such a review is "necessary" as M&A deals are expected to increase significantly in the future. 　　He said those M&A deals accounted for three percent of China's total foreign direct investment.

Get Ready: Here Comes the YuanThe wall is starting to crack.For years, China has made it tough for capital to flow to and from its economy, the second-largest in the world. Now, the government in Beijing is forging ahead with a campaign to bring the yuan onto the world stage and breaches are appearing in that formidable financial barrier.A yuan that's more widely used in international trade and investment could eventually challenge the dollar's supremacy, correct some of the imbalances that plague the Chinese and global economy, and force a profligate U.S. to live within its means.It won't be an easy transition. There are powerful vested interests in China that are satisfied with the status quo and will try to put the brakes on any reform effort. But the changes China has made so far have generated momentum both at home and internationally and may prove too strong to resist.For more than a decade, China's closed capital account has been a defining feature of the global economy. It has insulated the mainland from international capital flows, enabling China to ride out the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and leaving its banks unscathed by the near-collapse of the U.S. financial system in 2008.As important, denying foreign-exchange markets a role in setting the exchange rate has allowed the government to maintain the value of the yuan at an artificially low level supporting a 30-year export boom. Since Chinese savers can't take their money overseas, banks have also gotten away with offering them low interest rates, keeping the cost of capital for industry at bargain-basement prices and underpinning an investment binge.Take the example of Shenzhen a fishing village in 1979, in 2011 a metropolis of 14 million built around the world's fourth-busiest port. Low-cost capital subsidized the construction of transport and power infrastructure, factories and production lines. An undervalued yuan, combined with low cost of labor, enabled companies to undercut their foreign rivals on price.But manipulation of the exchange rate and repression of the interest rate comes at a cost. Cheap capital has resulted in overcapacity in the industrial sector and bubbles in the mainland's property market. Managing the exchange rate in the face of trade surpluses has resulted in the buildup of gargantuan foreign-exchange reserves $3.04 trillion that China has little choice but to recycle as cut-price loans to the U.S.One of the first cracks in China's restrictive policy came in July 2009. with a plan to allow settlement of import and export transactions in yuan. Wider international use of the yuan is intended to reduce transaction costs for China's importers and exporters, guard against the risk of a collapse in dollar trade financing as occurred at the end of 2008 and fly the flag for a rising economic world power.By the first quarter of 2011, $55 billion of China's trade 7% of the total was settled in yuan. At the end of April, yuan deposits in the Hong Kong banking system had risen to 511 billion, or $79 billion, up roughly ninefold from July 2009 when the settlement program was launched.Restrictions on outbound flows are also being lifted. In the past month, the Shanghai government announced plans to allow residents of the city to make investments overseas.But more substantial opening of the capital account will require progress in two areas: an exchange rate that is close to fair value and market-set interest rates. The yuan is still undervalued, but two factors suggest it's much closer to market value than it used to be: It has appreciated 20% in real terms against a trade-weighted basket of currencies since 2005, and China's current-account surplus fell to 5.2% of gross domestic product in 2010 from 10.1% in 2007.If the yuan is approaching fair value, the Chinese government will be able to loosen controls on the capital account with less chance of triggering destabilizing speculative inflows.China's interest rates, meanwhile, are still set by the government. But the People's Bank of China is attempting to make progress, by taking a leaf out of the mainland's economic history.At the beginning of the reform era, China's government designated Shenzhen as a special economic zone where market-based policies could be tried before being expanded to the rest of the country. Hong Kong will serve as a similar site of experimentation for reform of the mainland's financial system. Yields on yuan-denominated debt trading in Hong Kong are already set by the market rather than with reference to the People's Bank of China's benchmark interest rate.According to the Royal Bank of Scotland, the value of bonds outstanding in this so-called dim-sum market has risen to the equivalent of $15.8 billion from about $5.3 billion at the end of 2009. McDonald's Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. are among the companies that have turned to the new market for financing.The increase in trade settlement and the development of Hong Kong as a yuan financial center are mutually reinforcing. More yuan trade settlement adds to the pool of liquidity in Hong Kong, encouraging the development of more yuan investment products, and greater variety of investment products reinforces the incentive to use the yuan in trade settlement.What Comes NextNow pressure is building on China to open further channels into its capital markets. The question is whether change comes fast or slow. China's leaders seemed to be taking the cautious route. The target of making Shanghai an international financial center by 2020 was regarded as the de facto target date for capital-account opening. But the rapid progress of the past year has raised expectations of opening earlier.If China accelerates its timetable, the implications are enormous. A higher interest rate will mean slower expansion of investment, eating into the mainland's appetite for commodities and shifting the main domestic growth engine down a gear.A more expensive yuan will limit demand for exports that have catalyzed the explosive growth of China's east coast. Low-value-added makers of textiles, toys and tools—where margins are razor thin—will be the first to shut up shop. High-technology manufacturers like Foxconn—the trade name of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which makes the iPad—have already decided to move production facilities inland, to find cheaper labor away from the coast.The same dynamic that will make investment less affordable and exporting less profitable means more spending power for China's households—kick-starting efforts to bring domestic demand to the fore as a driver of growth. In the U.S., businesses from Napa Valley wine makers to manufacturers of cinema projectors in Nebraska are hoping to cash in on the rise of the Chinese consumer.Not all of the changes will be so positive for the U.S. Reduced intervention by China in foreign-exchange markets will lead to a reduction in demand for U.S. Treasury debt, not just from China but also from other Asian nations that have followed China's lead in managing their exchange rates. That will increase the cost of borrowing for the U.S., making it more difficult to finance public debt and continued current-account deficits.Displacing the Dollar?The next step in the development of the yuan as an international currency—a role as a reserve currency held by central banks—will require more substantial progress. A capital account that still remains tightly controlled means the Chinese currency can't fulfill the main function of reserves: a liquid asset that central banks can use to stabilize the value of their domestic currency.The transition to an open capital account won't be easy. Powerful interest groups in the export sector, state-owned enterprises, banks and local government benefit from a low interest rate and undervalued yuan. The door to reform is not wide open, but neither is it locked.Reform has its own logic and its own momentum. Companies that raise yuan financing offshore today will demand increased opportunities to bring those yuan onto the mainland tomorrow. If interest rates are higher offshore, investors on the mainland will find opportunities to move their yuan in the other direction. If legitimate channels don't exist, companies with an onshore and offshore presence will find ways of circumventing China's capital controls.We aren't there yet. Yuan deposits in Hong Kong aren't yet equal to 1% of those on the mainland. But the pool of offshore yuan, available at interest rates set by the market, is growing fast—reducing the effectiveness of China's capital controls and the ability of the central bank to use administrative tools to control the mainland economy.When the tide of offshore yuan starts to wash over the wall Beijing has built around its domestic financial system, the impact on the Chinese and the world economy will be far-reaching. China's closed capital account has been the defining feature of the world economy in the past decade; its opening could be the defining feature of the decade ahead.Tom OrlikMr. Orlik is a writer for The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column, based in Beijing.

China's not doing us a favorBy Fareed Zakaria, CNNWhat struck me this past week was China's reaction to our credit downgrade. Its state-run media thundered that America needed to "cure its addiction" to debt.A Hong Kong newspaper widely read on the mainland ran a front page with a banner saying "The American Dream is Over."  It went on to report that Washington owes every single Chinese citizen 5,700 Yuan - about 900 U.S. dollars.Another editorial said Washington's solution to its debt time bomb was to make the fuse one inch longer.That kind of commentary has hit a nerve with the Chinese people. After a drop in Shanghai's stock market, bloggers took to local social media sites. One wrote: "The U.S. suffered a downgrade, why did we become the biggest victim?" Another said: "It was a huge mistake to buy U.S. bonds with Chinese taxpayer money. We must hold those who are involved responsible."Here in the U.S. you hear many people worry that the Chinese government might stop buying American T-Bills. I think these fears are vastly overblown.The economic situation between China and the U.S. is the financial version of mutually assured destruction - that cold war doctrine of nuclear deterrence. If you destroy me, I will destroy you.Let me explain. I'll start with the facts. China is indeed America's biggest foreign lender - it owns about 1.2 trillion dollars of debt - more than Japan, the UK and Brazil.A little-known fact is that most of America's debt - 14.3 trillion and counting - is owned by Americans in Social Security trusts, pension funds, and by the Federal Reserve.But it is the marginal buyer that matters, so China is important. Imagine that China were to sell off those 1.2 trillion dollars of U.S. Treasury bonds. This is a huge hypothetical - but let's play out the disastrous chain of events that would happen if China began to divest.It would trigger panic selling of the dollar. That would in turn hurt the U.S. economy, which is China's number one export market (not a good idea if you are the Beijing government trying to keep workers occupied in factories across China).China is addicted to a strategy of export-led growth, which requires that it keep its goods cheap. This means keeping its currency undervalued. That's why it buys dollars.But could China stop or slow down its new purchases of American debt? Yes, but even here, it has fewer options than people think. As China's export growth continues, it will keep adding to its foreign reserves of 3.2 trillion dollars. Where can it park that money? Does it want to invest in Japanese debt and make the Yen a reserve currency? Anyone who understands the deep animosity between China and Japan will see that this is unlikely.Euro-denominated assets are a possibility - but there's really no such thing as European Treasury bonds. And even then, do you really want to put all your eggs in the euro when the future of the currency looks more shaky than ever before? Can you be confident that it will even be around 15 years from now?As for British pounds and Swiss francs, you can buy those but just not in the vast quantities that China needs given the cash it generates.And of course, if China were to stop buying Treasuries, the value of the Yuan would rise, Chinese exports would become more expensive and employment in China would fall.So at the very moment China's bloggers and state-run media were blasting the U.S. government for its profligacy, guess what Beijing was doing?It was buying U.S. Treasuries.The reality is that China is trapped into a cycle of buying our T-bonds.  No matter what any ratings agency says, no other bond market is as big or as safe.So ignore all those theories about China doing America a huge favor. The reality is, they have nowhere else to go. We're probably doing them a favor.And by the way, in terms of who is paying whom, data from the Congressional Budget Office shows that the U.S. pays out some 74 million dollars to China in interest payments on debt every day. We did the math. That means Washington is paying Beijing 833 dollars every second.For more of my thoughts through the week, I invite you to follow me on Facebook and Twitter and to bookmark the Global Public Square.http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/14/why-china-needs-u-s/Impressive.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////2011-01-27 16:18:42 Japan faces ratings downgrade By Daily Mail ReporterLast updated at 8:48 AM on 27th January 2010Comments (0) Add to My Stories Concerns are mounting over the health of the Japanese economy, which like Britain is mired in debt and is struggling to emerge from its most damaging slump in generations. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's yesterday warned it could downgrade Japanese debt because of the country's ballooning budget deficit. As it placed the world's second-largest economy on 'negative' outlook, S&P signalled that Japan could soon be stripped of its AA credit rating if it doesn't put its finances in order. It sounded the alarm just days after the Tokyo government revealed its national debt will spiral to some £6.7trillion by April, which is nearly double its national income. The move highlights the growing concerns on international money markets over the crippling loans many countries have been forced to take out in the financial crisis. Last May S&P sent shockwaves across the City after placing Britain's prized AAArating on review for a downgrade amid fears over public borrowing. Like the UK, Japan has poured unprecedented sums into its economy in an attempt to prevent a deflationary spiral of falling prices and plummeting economic growth. Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1246397/Japan-faces-ratings-downgrade.html#ixzz1CDo8rpAx1、mire 泥沼 2、balloon 激增 3、deflationary spiral 紧缩的螺旋式上升 4、plummet 暴跌plummet, deflationary http://www.douban.com/note/131981345////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////首帖原帖移存
