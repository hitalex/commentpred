Know your onionsMeaningTo be experienced in or knowledgeable about a subject. OriginThe English grammarian and lexicographer C. T. (Charles Talbut) Onions was an editor of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1895 and continued to write reference works throughout a long and distinguished career. His last work was The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology (1966), which was published a year after his death. If I knew as much etymology as he did I could certainly claim to 'know my onions', and it is tempting to assume that this is where the phrase originated. While it is true that 'know your onions' was coined at a time when C. T. Onions had established a reputation (i.e. during the 1920s), the match between the phrase and his name is just a coincidence. Know your onions is in fact an American phrase. There are many references to it in print there from the 1920s onward, but none in the UK or elsewhere until the middle of the century. For example, this from Harper's Magazine, March 1922:"Mr. Roberts knows his onions, all right."Another example comes soon afterwards, in The Lima News, May 1923:"The Columbus statement declares that the league is ready to give the Donahey boom every aid and comfort. Of course! Why not? Governor Donahey knows his onions..."Other phrases that refer to knowing - 'know the ropes', 'know your own mind' etc. allude to specific items as the focus of the knowledge. Other 1920s variants of 'know your onions' are 'know your oil/oats/apples' etc. The only one that caught on and is still in common use is 'know your onions'. So, why onions? Well, as the citation above asks - why not? Explanations that relate the phrase to knowledgeable vegetable gardeners, or even to C. T. Onions, are just trying too hard. 1920s America was a breeding ground for wacky phrases (see the bee's knees for some examples) and this is just another of those.http://www.douban.com/group/topic/1449210/?start=200#last

Stool pigeonMeaningA decoy bird, or a police informer, or criminal's look-out or decoy.OriginMost reference sources say that this expression derives from the hunting practice of fixing a dead or replica pigeon on to a stool to act as a decoy to attract other birds. What the stool in question was isn't entirely clear. It certainly wasn't the three-legged piece of furniture we now know, but one of the many other meanings of the word. In the 16th century a 'stoale' was the base of a tree - what we would now call a stump, just the place for a decoy bird to sit. It is also possible that 'stool' is derived from 'estale', which is an early French word applied to a pigeon used to entice a hawk into a net. It isn't far from 'estale pigeon' to 'stool pigeon'. All of that seems quite straightforward, except for the fact that the term 'stool pigeon', or 'stoolie', doesn't appear in print until the 19th century and in a completely different context. It is first used in American publications and referred to criminals who lured others into crime rather than to decoy birds. The earliest example I can find of the expression is from May 1816 when it was used in the Gettysburg paper The Adams Centinel, in a story about fraudulent paper-makers, i.e. counterfeiters. Unfortunately, the print quality of the paper make it difficult to read the full context, but it does describe someone involved in encouraging the passing of counterfeit banknotes as a 'procuror or stool pigeon'. There are examples of decoy ducks being described as 'stools' from 1825 onwards, but the term 'stool pigeon' isn't used with that meaning until 1871, when M. Schele De Vere listed it in Americanisms; the English of the New World:Stool-Pigeon... it means the pigeon, with its eyes stitched up, fastened on a stool, which can be moved up and down by the hidden fowler. It could be that decoy ducks have been called 'stool (or estale) pigeons' since the 1500s but no one wrote the terms down, although that seems rather unlikely. What we do know is that the current meaning of informer came into being in the USA around the middle of the 19th century. The Sheboygan Mercury printed a piece in August 1851 about the prevailing political situation in Italy:"Everyone fears that his confederate may prove a traitor... and avoided as a Police stool-pigeon and spy."The most likely explanation of the phrase's origin is that it was coined to describe those police informers who hung around bars (on stools no doubt) in order to pick up underworld gossip but that the name was influenced by the earlier, but as then unamed, hunting decoys.

Cold shoulder 　　 　　Meaning 　　 　　A display of coldness or indifference, intended to wound. 　　 　　Origin 　　 　　The origin of this expression which is often repeated is that visitors to a house who were welcome were given a hot meal but those who weren't were offered only ' cold shoulder of mutton'. This is repeated in several etymological texts, including Hendrickson's usually reliable 'Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins'. There's no evidence to support this view though and it appears to be an example of folk etymology. 　　 　　The first reference to the phrase in print is in Sir Walter Scott's 'The Antiquary', 1816: 　　 　　"The Countess抯 dislike didna gang farther at first than just showing o?the cauld shouther". 　　 　　'Cauld' is Scottish dialect for 'cold'. Should you doubt that 'shouther' means 'shoulder', Scott goes on the use the word in other contexts which make the meaning clear. For example, "They were stout hearts the race of Glenallan, ... they stood shouther to shouther". 　　 　　Note that the shoulder is shown, not eaten - there's no reference to food here. Likewise, in a slightly later work of Scott's - St. Ronan's Well, 1824: 　　 　　"I must tip him the cold shoulder, or he will be pestering me eternally." 　　 　　Scott coined several phrases, e.g. 'lock, stock and barrel'. The fact that the two earliest known citations of'cold shoulder' come from his writing would suggest he coined this too. 　　 　　The phrase began appearing in print frequently after the 1820s and Dickens used it in 1840 in The Old Curiosity Shop. By that time it had migrated across the Atlantic and appears there in a 'letter to the editor' in the New England newspaper The Bangor Daily Whig and Courier, June 1839: 　　 　　'... eminent individuals and his cabinet advisers turned "the cold shoulder" to their ambassador, for his independent act upon this occasion.' 　　 　　Again, there's no connection here to food and the presence of quotation marks indicate that the phrase is being used allusively. 　　 　　All in all, there is little reason to explain the derivation of 'cold shoulder' as anything other than a description of aloofness and disdain, and the source of it as Sir Walter Scott.

Spruce-upMeaningTo make smart and trim.OriginSpruce-up is just a little phrase, but it has taken quite a journey to get to us in its present state. The state it started from was Prussia. The 14th century word spruce is a variant of Pruce, which was itself a shortened version of Prussia. Originally, things that were spruce were those items brought from Prussia. For example, spruce fir trees and, more to the point for this phrase, spruce leather. From the end of the 16th century, spruce was used as a verb meaning 'to make trim and neat'. In The terrors of the night, or, a discourse of apparitions, 1594, Thomas Nashe equates 'sprucing' with 'cleaning':[You shall] spend a whole twelue month in spunging & sprucing. A jerkin made from the expensive imported spruce leather was the fashion accessory of choice for Tudor and Stuart noblemen. Robert Greene, in A Quip for an Upstart Courtier - a quaint dispute between Cloth-breeches and Velvet-breeches, 1592, paints a picture of the dandy of the day: "A fellow briskly apparelled, in a blacke taffata doublet, and a spruce leather jerkin with christall buttons."The first mention of 'sprucing-up' comes in Sir George Etherege's Restoration drama The Man of Mode, 1676: "I took particular notice of one that is alwaies spruc'd up..."There's no doubt that in the 16th century 'spruce' meant 'trim and neat', nor is there doubt that spruce jerkins were considered smart apparel. The link between the two, although not absolutely proven, seems clear enough. So, to really spruce yourself up you need a leather jacket.

Short shriftMeaningTo make short work of - to give little consideration to. OriginShrift? Not a word you hear every day. In fact, apart from in this expression, it is now so rarely used that it's hard to think of a shrift that isn't short. A shrift is a penance (a prescribed penalty) imposed by a priest in a confession in order to provide absolution, often when the confessor was near to death. In the 17th century, criminals were sent to the scaffold immediately after sentencing and only had time for a 'short shrift' before being hanged.Shakespeare was the first to write it down, in Richard III, 1594.RATCLIFF: Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.It doesn't appear again in print until 1814, Scott's Lord of the Isles:"Short were his shrift in that debate. If Lorn encounter'd Bruce!"That seems an uncommonly long time to wait for a phrase that is in regular use. We can assume that, given the gap, the phrase wasn't part of the language in Shakespeare's day, or for some time afterwards, and that he coined it himself. Some sources cite it as '14th century', but neglect to offer any evidence to support that. It didn't migrate across the Atlantic quickly either. The first citation there is from the Adams Sentinel, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, August 1841:"The negroes were to be tried on Wednesday, and it was believed that a short shrift and a speedy doom would be awarded to the guilty."See other phrases and sayings from Shakespeare.

Spitting imageMeaningThe exact likeness. Origin One of the very first questions that was asked at the Phrasefinder bulletin board was about 'spitting image'. There have been numerous such queries there since and some ask if the term was originally 'splitting image', i.e. deriving from the two matching parts of a split plank of wood. That's a plausible idea. The mirror image matching of the grain of split wood has long been used in furniture and musical instruments for decorative effect. The technique is known as book-matching and the resulting pattern is called fiddleback - for obvious reasons. The theory has its adherents and dates back to at least 1939, when Dorothy Hartley included it in her book Made in England:"Evenness and symmetry are got by pairing the two split halves of the same tree, or branch. (Hence the country saying: he's the 憇plitting image?- an exact likeness.)"As so often though, plausibility isn't the end of the story. The numerous forms of the term 'spitting image' - spit and image, spitten image, the dead spit of etc., appear not to derive from 'split' but from 'spit'. Some commentators have suggested that 'spit' may be a corruption of 'spirit', but that appears to be fanciful and isn't backed up by any early examples of 'spirit and image'. The allusion is more likely to be to someone who is so similar to another as to appear to have been spat out of his mouth. That idea, if not the exact phrase, was in circulation by the end of the 17th century, when George Farquhar used it in his comic play Love and a bottle, 1689:"Poor child! he's as like his own dadda as if he were spit out of his mouth." No version of the phrase is especially old. The earliest reference is in Andrew Knapp and W. Baldwin's The Newgate Calendar, 1824?6:"A daughter, ... the very spit of the old captain."This pre-dates any 'splitting image' citation by a good hundred years, which tends to rule out the latter as the source. 'Spit' or 'dead spit', with the meaning of likeness, appears in print several times in the 19th century. Here 'dead' means precise or exact, as in dead ringer. Toward the end of the 19th century we find 'spit and image'. In 1895, an author called E. Castle published Lt. of Searthey, containing the line:"She's like the poor lady that's dead and gone, the spit an' image she is."Finally, we get to the first known use of 'spitting image' - in A. H. Rice's Mrs. Wiggs, 1901:"He's jes' like his pa - the very spittin' image of him!"

True blueMeaningLoyal and unwavering in one's opinions or support for a cause. Origin'True blue' is supposed to derive from the blue cloth that was made at Coventry, England in the late middle ages. The town's dyers had a reputation for producing material that didn't fade with washing, i.e. it remained 'fast' or 'true'. The phrase 'as true as Coventry blue' originated then and is still used (in Coventry at least). The town's standing was recorded in 1670 by John Ray in the first edition of A Compleat Collection of English Proverbs:"Coventry had formerly the reputation for dying of blues; insomuch that true blue became a Proverb to signifie one that was always the same and like himself."There are other theories as to the origin of 'true blue'. For example, the representation in paintings of the Virgin Mary in blue clothing, the purity of lineage of the Spanish nobility (see also blue blood), or the blue aprons worn by butchers. These derivations are unlikely as they aren't supported by documentary evidence that link them to 'true blue'. The Coventry story also has the added credence of closely matching the 'steadfast, unwavering' meaning of the phrase. The change from the literal 'fast' coloured cloth to the allusory 'steadfast' loyal supporters came around the time that Ray was writing his book of proverbs. The Covenanters were a group of 17th century Scottish Presbyterians who swore to uphold the National Covenant and oppose the rule of James I of Scotland. They wore blue as their badge and those who unequivocally supported the cause were called 'true blue'. Samuel Butler referred to this denomination in the satirical poem Hudibras, 1663:For his Religion it was FitTo match his learning and wit; 'Twas Presbyterian true blueThe Covenanters are no longer active but conservative politics still maintains an association with the phrase. Blue was later adopted as the colour of the Tory Party in England (later called the Conservative Party). Staunch Conservative supporters, those whom Margaret Thatcher would have called 'one of us', are known as 'true blue' Tories.

Tell it to the marinesMeaningA scornful response to a tall and unbelieved story.OriginThe US Marine Corps are probably the best-known marines these days and this American-sounding phrase is often thought to refer to them. This isn't an American phrase though and, although it has been known there since the 1830s, it originated in the UK and the marines in question were the Royal Marines. Most of the early citations give a fuller version of the phrase - "You may tell that to the marines, but the sailors will not believe it." The shorter version we use now didn't appear until 1864, in Anthony Trollope's novel A Small House at Allington:"Is that a story to tell to such a man as me! You may tell it to the marines!"The first marines were The Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot, formed in 1664, in the reign of Charles II. They were soldiers who had been enlisted and trained to serve on board ships. The recruits were considered green and not on a par with hardened sailors, hence the implication that marines were naive enough to believe ridiculous tales, but that sailors weren't. Such a tall tale is often quoted as the source of this phrase. It is said King Charles II made a remark to Samuel Pepys in which he mocked the marines' credulity in their belief in flying fishes. That's a nice story, but it has been shown to be a hoax that was perpetrated in the 1900s by the novelist W. P. Drury - a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal Marines.The phrase actually originated in John Davis's The Post-Captain, or, The wooden walls well manned comprehending a view of naval society and manners, 1804:"He may tell that to the marines, but the sailors will not believe him."

Tuckered outMeaningExhausted. OriginIt will come as no surprise that 'tuckered out' is an American phrase. No 'B-feature' western from the 1930s and 1940s was complete without Gabby Hayes being 'plumb tuckered out'. Hayes' contribution to the genre was celebrated by Mel Brooks in the 1974 film Blazing Saddles. In that, a look-alike actor played the part of Gabby Johnson, spouting 'authentic frontier gibberish' - "dad gum it, I am gonna die here an' no sidewindin bushwackin, hornswaglin, cracker croaker is gonna rouin me biscuit cutter".'Plumb' is just an intensifier. 'Tuckered out' is rarely seen alone. People are 'plumb', 'clear', 'well-nigh' or, as in the earliest example that I've found, 'prodigiously', 'tuckered out'. That example is from the Wisconsin Enquirer, April 1839:"I reckoned to have got to the tavern by sundown, but I haven't - as I'm prodigiously tuckered out."'Plumb tuckered out' is somewhat later and the first example I have of that is from the Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette, February 1989:"They'll get plumb tuckered out waitin."'Tuckered out' is often applied to children. There doesn't however seem to be a link to 'Tommy Tucker', that member of the 'little' club of nursery rhyme characters - 'Little Bo-Peep', 'Little Boy Blue', 'Little Jack Horner' and 'Little Miss Muffet'. 'Little Tommy Tucker' may not have been very big and he sang for his supper, but there's no mention of him being especially tired.The actual derivation of this phrase is quite prosaic. 'Tucker' is a colloquial New England verb, coined in the early 19th century, meaning 'tired or weary'. 'Tuckered out' is just a straightforward use of that.

A sledgehammer to crack a nutMeaning'Using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut' is using disproportionate force or expense to overcome a minor problem. OriginSledge-hammers are large iron hammers which were first used in England in the 15th century. These weren't tools to hammer sledges - the little ice trolleys with runners that the young Citizen Kane was so fond of. 'Sledge' was the original name of that form of hammer; so 'sledgehammer' is somewhat of a tautology. 'Sledging' has recently reappeared as a verb form in the previously refined and gentle world of cricket, where it means the browbeating and harassment of the batsman by the fielders. 'Sledges' were an English invention but this phrase wasn't - it first saw the light of day in 1850s America. 'A sledgehammer to crack a nut' is one of the many versions of the phrase, the others having faded into disuse. The spelling of 'sledgehammer' hasn't yet settled down and is still making the usual progression of hyphenated words pairs, i.e. from 'sledge hammer', to 'sledge-hammer' and eventually, 'sledgehammer'. The OED prefers the hyphen, but 'sledgehammer' is now the more common spelling. Pretty well anything which is small and easy to squash has come verbally under the hammer; typified by nuts or insects. These have included peanuts, walnuts or just nuts; also gnats, flies, mosquitoes etc. The first to fall victim was the humble fly, as in this piece from The Gettysburg Compiler, June 1878:"Don't worry over little ills of life. It is like taking a sledge hammer to kill a fly."Nuts came into the picture a little later, specifically peanuts. For example, this from The Reno Weekly Gazette And Stockman, May 1893:"We know some men who are always looking for a sledge hammer to crack a peanut."Insects and nuts seem to have become combined in the later 'sledgehammer to kill a gnat' version. For example, Grosvenor B. Clarkson's Industrial America in The World War, 1923:"The Board never used a sledgehammer to kill a gnat."Oddly, although the common form is now 'a sledgehammer to crack a nut', the first examples of that in print date from as late the 1960s.

Blue-plate special 　　 　　Meaning 　　 　　A set meal provided at a reduced price. 　　 　　Origin 　　 　　The phrase 'blue plate special' isn't widely known here in the UK. In fact, until questions were asked about it at our bulletin board, I'd not come across it before. It is American and originated there around the start of the 20th century. 　　 　　Considering that the expression has been in common use in the USA for a century or so, the usual US reference sources have little to say about it. A useful first port of call when researching American colloquial expressions is Lighter's Historical Dictionary of American Slang, but the term isn't listed there. Webster's Dictionary does help out by defining 'blue plate' as: 　　 　　1. A restaurant dinner plate divided into compartments for serving several kinds of food as a single order. 　　2. A main course (as of meat and vegetable) served as a single menu item. 　　 　　Webster's doesn't cite an origin but there seems little reason to look further than the colour for the derivation of the phrase - blue plate specials were served on blue plates, usually divided into sections for meat, potatoes etc. Nor does there seem to have been anything especially significant about the colour. Cobalt-blue has been commonly used as a pigment for crockery since the Chinese developed the Willow Pattern design in the 17th century. The number of pieces of blue and white pottery that gardeners find is evidence of its past popularity in both the UK and USA. 　　 　　Blue plate specials don't invoke images of what gourmets call 'fine dining'; we are more in the region here of the establishments that Singer and Zaret wrote about in the song 'One Meat Ball', with its sad lyric 'you get no bread with one meat ball'. 　　 　　The earliest citation of the phrase that I've found is in this advert for the Young Women's Christian Association, printed in the Illinois newspaper The Decatur Daily Review, September 1924. 　　 　　The food writer Daniel Rogov claims that blue-plate special was first used on 22 October 1892, on a menu of a Fred Harvey restaurant on the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad. I've not seen a copy of that menu and so can't confirm Rogov's assertion, although the use of so specific a date would seem odd if it weren't taken from an actual menu.

Wild goose chaseMeaningA hopeless quest.OriginThis phrase is old and appears to be one of the many phrases introduced to the language by Shakespeare. The first recorded citation is from Romeo and Juliet, 1592:Romeo: Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.Mercutio: Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five.Our current use of the phrase alludes to an undertaking which will probably prove to be fruitless - clearly wild geese are difficult to catch. Our understanding of the term differs from that in use in Shakespeare's day. The earlier meaning related not to hunting but to horse racing. A 'wild goose chase' was a chase in which horses followed a lead horse at a set distance, mimicking wild geese flying in formation. The equine connection was referred to in another early citation, just ten years after Shakespeare - Nicholas Breton's The Mother's Blessing, 1602:"Esteeme a horse, according to his pace, But loose no wagers on a wilde goose chase."That meaning had been lost by the 19th century. In Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1811, he defines the term much the way we do today: "A tedious uncertain pursuit, like the following a flock of wild geese, who are remarkably shy."The 1978 film 'The Wild Geese' alluded to the phrase in its title. The plot of the film involved a group of mercenaries embarking on a near-impossible mission. Of course, the near-impossible is no problem for action heroes and they caught their prey.

Aid and abetMeaningTo help and encourage, usually in the commission of a crime or anti-social act. Origin'Aid and abet' is a common enough expression but, whilst 'aid' is well-known, what does 'abet' mean exactly? The word derives from the French 'abeter' - to hound, which itself derives from the Norse 'beita' - to cause to bite. The phrase 'aid and abet' was coined in the late 18th century, by which time the term 'abet' had lost its original 'cause to bite' meaning. An early example of its use dates from 1798, when George Washington included it in a letter, first published in Writings, 1893. He didn't appear to have any better opinion of the French than that of the present US administration concerning the Gallic reluctance to aid and abet the war in Iraq:"My mind is not a little agitated by the outrageous conduct of France towards the United States, and at the inimitable conduct of its partisans, who aid and abet their measures." Bear baiting, or as it was first called 'bear abetting', was a popular entertainment in England between the 16th and 19th centuries. It took place in pits in 'bear gardens', in which tethered bears were torn to pieces by trained bulldogs. Such pits were commonplace and some still exist - for example the Bear Pit in Sheffield Botanical Gardens. The 'sport' wasn't viewed with the distaste we now have for animal cruelty - Queen Elizabeth condoned the practice by attending baitings, one of which resulted in 13 dead bears. The Elizabethan writer Robert Laneham described the scene:"It was a sport very pleasant to see, to see the bear, with his pink eyes, tearing after his enemies approach... and when he was loose to shake his ears twice or thrice with the blood and the slaver hanging about his physiognomy." So, if you plan to help someone, aid them by all means, but no biting please.

In the doldrumsMeaningIn low spirits; feeling dull and drowsy.OriginThe Doldrums is the region of calm winds, centered slightly north of the equator and between the two belts of trade winds, which meet there and neutralize each other. It is widely assumed that the phrase 'in the doldrums' is derived from the name of this region. Actually, it's the other way about. In the 19th century, 'doldrum' was a word meaning 'dullard; a dull or sluggish fellow' and this probably derived from 'dol', meaning 'dull' with its form taken from 'tantrum'. That is, as a tantrum was a fit of petulance and passion, a doldrum was a fit of sloth and dullness, or one who indulged in such. The term was used to mean 'a general state of low spirits' in the early 19th century. For example, this piece from The Morning Herald, April 1811:"I am now in the doldrums; but when I get better, I will send [for] you."In 1824, Lord Byron used the phrase in a nautical context in the verse tale The Island:"From the bluff head where I watch'd to-day, I saw her in the doldrums; for the wind Was light and baffling." [Note: baffling winds are those which are shifting and variable, making progress under sail impossible.] 'In the doldrums' came to refer specifically to sailing ships that were becalmed and unable to progress. The region now called the 'The Doldrums' wasn't named until the mid 19th century and the naming came about as the result of a misapprehension. When reports of ships that were becalmed in that equatorial region described them as being 'in the doldrums', it was mistakenly thought that the reports were describing their location rather than their state. The earliest known reference to the region's name in print is Matthew Maury's The physical geography of the sea, 1855:"The 'equatorial doldrums' is another of these calm places. Besides being a region of calms and baffling winds, it is a region noted for its rains."

By and largeMeaningOn the whole; generally speaking; all things considered.OriginMany phrases are wrongly ascribed a nautical origin just because they sound like mariner's lingo. This one really is and, like many such nautical phrases, it originated in the days of sail. To get a sense of the original meaning of the phrase we need to understand the nautical terms 'by' and 'large'. 'Large' is easier, so we'll start there. When the wind is blowing from some compass point behind a ship's direction of travel then it is said to be 'large'. Sailors have used this term for centuries. For example, this piece from Richard Hakluyt's The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation, 1591:"When the wind came larger we waied anchor and set saile."When the wind is in that favourable large direction the largest square sails may be set and the ship is able to travel in whatever downwind direction the captain sees fit.'By' is a rather more difficult concept for landlubbers like me. In simplified terms it means 'in the general direction of'. Sailors would say to be 'by the wind' is to face into the wind or within six compass points of it. The earliest known reference to 'by and large' in print is from Samuel Sturmy, in The Mariners Magazine, 1669:"Thus you see the ship handled in fair weather and foul, by and learge."To sail 'by and large' required the ability to sail not only as earlier square-rigged ships could do, i.e. downwind, but also against the wind. At first sight, and for many non-sailors I'm sure second and third sight too, it seems impossible that a sailing ship could progress against the wind. They can though. The physics behind this is better left to others. Suffice it to say that it involves the use of triangular sails which act like aeroplane wings and provide a force which drags the ship sideways against the wind. By the use of this and by careful angling of the rudder the ship can be steered slightly into the wind. The 19th century windjammers like Cutty Sark were able to maintain progress 'by and large' even in bad wind conditions by the use of many such aerodynamic triangular sails and large crews of able seamen.

Start from scratchMeaningBegin (again) from the beginning, embark on something without any preparation or advantage.Origin'Start from scratch' is an expression which has altered slightly in meaning since it was first coined. It is now usually used to mean 'start again from the beginning' - where an initial attempt has failed and a new attempt is made with nothing of value carried forward from the first attempt (as opposed to 'made from scratch' which means 'made from basic ingredients'). In the late 1800s, when 'start from scratch' began to be used it simply meant 'start with no advantage'. 'Scratch' has been used since the 18th century as a sporting term for a boundary or starting point which was scratched on the ground. The first such scratch was the crease which is a boundary line for batsmen in cricket. John Nyren's Young Cricketer's Tutor, 1833 records this line from a 1778 work by Cotton:"Ye strikers... Stand firm to your scratch, let your bat be upright." It is the world of boxing that has given us the concept of 'starting from scratch'. The scratched line there specified the positions of boxers who faced each other at the beginning of a bout. This is also the source of 'up to scratch', i.e. meet the required standard, as pugilists would have had to do when offering themselves for a match.Scratch later came to be used as the name of any starting point for a race. The term came to be used in 'handicap' races where weaker entrants were given a head start. For example, in cycling those who were given no advantage had the handicap of 'starting from scratch', while others started ahead of the line. Other sports, notably golf, have taken up the figurative use of scratch as the term for 'with no advantage - starting from nothing'. The Fort Wayne Gazette, April 1887, contains the earliest reference to 'starting from scratch' that I can find, in a report of a 'no-handicap' cycling race:"It was no handicap. Every man was qualified to and did start from scratch."

Skid rowMeaningA squalid district inhabited by the impoverished and destitute.OriginThis American expression came into being in the Great Depression. Residence on Skid Row evokes imagery of someone who was slipping down in society - 'on the skids'. These skids weren't just figurative though, they did exist. In the late 19th century there was an expansion of the logging industry in the USA, especially in the north-west states, and millions of trees were felled to supply the building trade. Large tree-trunks were hauled, either to sawmills or to the nearest road, river or railway, along tracks made of greased timbers. These were known to loggers as 'skid roads'. The 1880 Topographical Survey of the Adirondack Region refers to these:"... lumbermen had cut 'skid-roads' on which logs were drawn [etc.]."How these forest tracks came to be associated with the down-market locale of people who were living on the breadline, or where the first such Skid Road was, is uncertain. It could well be that, due to the unreliability of employment in the timber-felling trade, loggers hung around on the skid roads hoping for work. This, combined with the 'sliding down' imagery and the fact that skid roads leading to town sawmills or railways were built 'on the wrong side of the tracks' is surely enough to link skid roads with the bottom end of society. The alteration from 'skid road' to 'skid row' came later and was well-established by the 1930s. The lexicographer Godfrey Irwin defined it in American tramp and underworld slang, 1931:"Skid row, the district where workers congregate when in town or away from their job."

On the wagonMeaning'On the wagon' - abstaining from alcohol. 'Off the wagon' - returned to drinking after an attempt to give it up. OriginSuggested explanations of the origin of 'on the wagon' focus on actual wagons that were used to transport people; for example, condemned prisoners who had taken their last drink in this life and were transported to the gallows by wagon. Another story has it that Evangeline Booth, the US Salvation Army National Commander, toured the Bowery slums in a wagon picking up drunks and delivering them to sobriety. The phrase predates Booth's work in New York, so that can't be the origin. It isn't far from the truth though, but, as we'll see below, no actual wagon rides were involved. 'On the wagon' was coined in the USA around the turn of the 20th century. The phrase began as 'on the water-cart', migrated to 'on the water-wagon' and finally to 'on the wagon'. The late 19th century saw the emergence of several temperance organisations, notably The Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1893 and The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, founded in 1874. These followed on from the work of The Abstinence Society which had encouraged millions of men to 'take the pledge'. The Pledge wasn't just a vague intention to avoid drink; it was a specific and absolute promise never to drink again and was taken very seriously:"I promise to abstain from all intoxicating drinks except used medicinally and by order of a medical man, and to discountenance the cause and practice of intemperance.Water wagons were a commonplace sight in US cities at the time. They didn't carry drinking water but were used to damp down dusty streets during dry weather. Those who had vowed to give up drink and were tempted to lapse said that they would drink from the water-cart rather than take strong drink. The first reference to it that I've found in print is from Alice Caldwell Hegan's comic novel Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, 1901: I wanted to git him some whisky, but he shuck his head. "I'm on the water-cart."'Water-wagon' was soon used as an alternative and the distinction between the figurative phrase 'on the wagon' and real water-wagons was made clear in this piece from The Davenport Daily Leader, March 1904:"Peter Solle took a bad fall from the water wagon this morning. The water wagon was not that imaginary, visionary affair that is sometimes applied to he who signs the pledge, but was the real thing, all there and big as life."

Play ducks and drakesMeaningTo behave recklessly; to idly squander one's wealth. OriginDucks and drakes is the old English name for the pastime of skimming flat stones on the surface of water to make them bounce as many times as possible. There are various names for the game, for example, stone skipping in the USA and stone skimming in the UK; in fact most countries have their own name for it. I doubt that there's a child anywhere in the world who hasn't tried to establish his or her own record. Most people manage seven or eight bounces. In researching this phrase I was surprised to find that the world record, as endorsed by the Guinness Book of Records, stands at 40. That hardly seems possible, but there is video evidence of Kurt Steiner setting that record in 2002. The pastime surely pre-dates written records. The first known reference to it in print is in The nomenclator, or remembrancer of Adrianus Junius, translated by John Higgins in 1585:"A kind of sport or play with an oister shell or stone throwne into the water, and making circles yer it sinke, etc. It is called a ducke and a drake, and a halfe-penie cake."Why that name was chosen isn't clear. Most early citations give the phrase as 'make ducks and drakes' rather than 'play ducks and drakes', so it may be that the circular ripples that are formed evoked images of splashing waterfowl. For example, from the play Dick of Devon, circa 1626:"The poorest ship-boy Might on the Thames make duckes and drakes with pieces Of eight fetchd out of Spayne."Around the same time, the use of 'ducks and drakes' to refer to idly throwing something away or squandering resources came into use. That usage was recorded in James Cooke's Tu Quoque, 1614:"This royal Caesar doth regard no cash; Has thrown away as much in ducks and drakes As would have bought some 50,000 capons."The adoption of 'play ducks and drakes' meaning to throw away money seems to have come directly from the throwing of stones in the waterside game. The meaning now seems to have wandered closer toward the 'unreliable and reckless' and away from the original 'idly squandering'. This may be a simple migration of meaning over time, or it may be due to a confusion between 'playing ducks and drakes' and 'playing fast and loose'.

Get underwayMeaningBegin a journey or a project.OriginWe are familiar with this little expression but, like other idioms that we absorb when learning the language, it doesn't make much literal sense. Why 'under'? Why 'way'? It turns out that a confusing of several seafaring words had a bearing on the coining of this nautical phrase. 'Way' doesn't mean here road or route but has the specifically nautical meaning of 'the forward progress of a ship though the water', or the wake that the ship leaves behind. Way has been used like that since at least the 17th century. For example, this piece from Samuel Sturmy's Mariners Magazine, 1669:"If you sail against a Current, if it be swifter than the Ship's way, you fall a Stern."This usage continued into the 20th century and was also used in aviation as well as shipping. In 1911, The Times reported:"He shut off his engine and by so doing took the 'way' off the biplane."The term 'under sail' and 'underway' appear at first sight to be quite similar. The former seems easy to interpret, as sailing ships are literally under the sails when in motion, but what are we under in 'underway'? That is easier to understand when we know that this 'under' was originally 'on the'. Knowing that, 'on the way' makes sense. 'On the way' migrated to 'underway', probably due to the influence of the Dutch word 'onderweg', which translates into English as 'underway' but to 17th century sailors must have sounded more like 'on the way'. More confusion enters with doubts over the phrase's spelling. The term 'weigh anchor', and the fact that when ships are loaded with cargo and ready to sail they are weighed down, has lead to the phrase being written as 'under weigh'. This a common enough misspelling to have become almost standardised; so much so that, in his 1846 Nautical Dictionary, Arthur Young wrongly suggested that under weigh was in fact the correct original spelling: "Under way, this expression, often used instead of under weigh, seems to be a convenient one for denoting that a ship or boat is making progress through the water, whether by sails or other motive power."There seems little to justify it, but Young must have had some success in promoting that view as many prominent 19th century authors, including Thackeray, Herman Melville and Charles Dickens, all spelled the term that way - or should that be that weigh?The word 'way' is now flourishing as the converse of 'no way', but as 'a ship's progress' it is all but defunct. The loss of the association with shipping has removed the incentive to spell the phrase 'under weigh' and 'underway' is now universally used.

Curiosity killed the catMeaningInquisitiveness can lead one into dangerous situations.OriginEveryone knows that, despite its supposed nine lives, curiosity killed the cat. Well, not quite. The 'killed the cat' proverb originated as 'care killed the cat'. By 'care' the coiner of the expression meant 'worry/sorrow' rather than our more usual contemporary 'look after/provide for' meaning. That form of the expression is first recorded in the English playwright Ben Jonson's play Every Man in His Humour, 1598:"Helter skelter, hang sorrow, care'll kill a Cat, up-tails all, and a Louse for the Hangman."The play was one of the Tudor humours comedies, in which each major character is assigned a particular 'humour' or trait. The play is thought to have been performed in 1598 by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, a troupe of actors including William Shakespeare and William Kempe. Shakespeare was no slouch when it came to appropriating a memorable line and it crops up the following year in Much Ado About Nothing:"What, courage man! what though care killed a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care."The proverbial expression 'curiosity killed the cat', which is usually used when attempting to stop someone asking unwanted questions, is much more recent. The earlier form was still in use in 1898, when it was defined in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable:"Care killed the Cat. It is said that a cat has nine lives, but care would wear them all out."Curiosity hasn't received a good press over the centuries. Saint Augustine wrote in Confessions, AD 397, that, in the eons before creating heaven and earth, God "fashioned hell for the inquisitive". John Clarke, in Paroemiologia, 1639 suggested that "He that pryeth into every cloud may be struck with a thunderbolt". In Don Juan, Lord Byron called curiosity "that low vice". That bad opinion, and the fact that cats are notoriously inquisitive, lead to the source of their demise being changed from 'care' to 'curiosity'. The earliest known printed reference that uses the 'curiosity' form is O. Henry's Schools and Schools, 1909:"Curiosity can do more things than kill a cat; and if emotions, well recognized as feminine, are inimical to feline life, then jealousy would soon leave the whole world catless."The earliest version that I have found of the precise current form of the proverb in print is from The Portsmouth Daily Times, March 1915, in a piece headed The Height of Curiosity:Mother - "Don't ask so many questions, child. Curiosity killed the cat." Willie - "What did the cat want to know, Mom?"

Take umbrageMeaningTo be displeased or offended by the actions of others. OriginThere doesn't seem to much we can do with umbrage other than to take it, i.e. become displeased - the word is no longer used in any other context. What is umbrage exactly? It sounds like some form of distasteful patent medicine. Step back to the 15th century and umbrage didn't mean displeasure. The word was inherited into English from the Latin 'umbra', meaning shade. Umbrage came to be used in English to mean shade or shadow, or the foliage of trees which cause shadows. For example, this piece from John Lydgate's 1426 translation of De Guileville's Pilgrimage of the life of man:...my vysage whiche is clowded with vmbrage, 'Taking umbrage', i.e. sitting under a shady tree, had then no negative associations, as is made clear in Sir Thomas Elyot's The image of gouernance, 1540:The sayd trees gaue a commodyous and plesant vmbrage. Over time, the figurative use of umbrage to mean displeasure evolved, probably from the simple association of darkness with gloomy thoughts. In that meaning, umbrage was first said to be given rather than taken, as this example from Sir Nathaniel Brent's 1620 translation of the Historie of the council of Trent shows:He... therefore besought them to take away all those words that might give him any Vmbrage.The shade/disfavour metaphor is made explicit in this piece from Sir Robert Naunton's Fragmenta regalia, 1635:On the fall of the Duke he stood some yeers in umbrage, and without imployment. The first record of anyone taking umbrage is in Lord Fountainhall's [Chronological Notes on] The decisions of the Lords of Council and Session, 1680:The Bishop... took umbrage at his freedom of speech in the pulpit anent [side by side with] the government.

Rack and ruinMeaningComplete destruction. OriginIt might be thought that the rack in this phrase refers to the mediaeval torture device, as in the phrase rack one's brains. This rack is however a variant of the now defunct word wrack, more usually known to us now as wreck. The rather tautological use of the two similar words 'rack' and 'ruin' is for the sake of emphasis. In that respect the phrase follows the pattern of beck and call, chop and change, fair and square etc. The term 'going to wreck' was the forerunner of 'rack and ruin' and was used as early as 1548, in a sermon by Ephraim Udall:"The flocke goeth to wrecke and vtterly perisheth."Henry Bull moved the phrase on to 'wrack and ruin' in his translation of Luther's Commentarie upon the fiftene psalmes, 1577:"Whiles all things seeme to fall to wracke and ruine."We finally get to the contemporary 'rack and ruin' in 1599, when the Oxford historian Thomas Fowler published The history of Corpus Christi College:"In the mean season the College shall goe to rack and ruin."Judging from the accompanying picture the college seems to have survived the following 400 years quite well, and Fowler need not have worried.

Coin a phraseMeaningCreate a new phrase.Origin'To coin a phrase' is now rarely used with its original 'invent a new phrase' meaning but is almost always used ironically to introduce a banal or clichéd sentiment. This usage began in the mid 20th century. For example, in Francis Brett Young's novel Mr. Lucton's Freedom, 1940:"It takes all sorts to make a world, to coin a phrase."Coining, in the sense of creating, derives from the coining of money by stamping metal with a die. Coins - also variously spelled coynes, coigns, coignes or quoins - were the blank, usually circular, disks from which money was minted. This usage derived from an earlier 14th century meaning of coin, which meant wedge. The wedge-shaped dies which were used to stamp the blanks were called coins and the metal blanks and the subsequent 'coined' money took their name from them.Coining later began to be associated with inventiveness in language. In the 16th century the 'coining' of words and phrases was often referred to. By that time the monetary coinage was often debased or counterfeit and the coining of words was often associated with spurious linguistic inventions. For example, in George Puttenham's The arte of English poesie, 1589:"Young schollers not halfe well studied... will seeme to coigne fine wordes out of the Latin."Shakespeare, the greatest coiner of them all, also referred to the coining of language in Coriolanus, 1607:"So shall my Lungs Coine words till their decay."Quoin has been retained as the name of the wedge-shaped keystones or corner blocks of buildings. Printers also use the term as the name for the expandable wedges that are used to hold lines of type in place in a press. This has provoked some to suggest that 'coin a phrase' derives from the process of quoining (wedging) phrases in a printing press. That is not so. 'Quoin a phrase' is recorded nowhere and 'coining' meant 'creating' from before the invention of printing in 1440. Co-incidentally, printing does provide us with a genuine derivation that links printing with linguistic banality - cliché. This derives from the French cliquer, from the clicking sound of the stamp used to make metal typefaces.'Coin a phrase' itself arises much later than the invention of printing - the 19th century in fact. The earliest use of the term that I have found is in the Wisconsin newspaper The Southport American, July 1848:"Had we to find... a name which should at once convey the enthusiasm of our feelings towards her, we would coin a phrase combining the extreme of admiration and horror and term her the Angel of Assassination."

To a TMeaningExactly; properly. Often used in the phrase 'suits to a T'. Origin'To a T', which is sometimes written 'to a tee', is an old phrase and is first recorded in James Wright's satire The Humours and conversations of the town, 1693:"All the under Villages and Towns-men come to him for Redress; which he does to a T."It is difficult to determine the origin of this phrase. It would be helpful to know the correct spelling; 'T' or 'tee'. The proposed derivations that assume the latter are:The phrase derives from the sports of golf or curling, which have a tee as the starting or ending point respectively. The curling usage would seem to match the meaning better as the tee is the precise centre of the circle in which players aim to stop their stones. However, neither sport is referred to in any of the early citations of the phrase and there's really no evidence to support either derivation apart from use of the word 'tee'. The 'to a tee' version isn't recorded at all until 1771 when J. Giles used it in his Poems:"I'll tell you where You may be suited to a tee."John Jamieson, in the etymological dictionary Jamieson's Dictionary of the Scottish Language, 1867, records 'to a tee' as 'to a tittle'. If even a 19th century Scots lexicographer doesn't support the Scottish sports origin they would seem to lack credibility. Given Wright's earliest 'to a T' usage and the lack of evidence to support the 'tee' version, it is safe to assume the proper spelling is 'to a T'. So, what T was meant? Again, there are alternatives; 'T-shirt', or 'T-square', or some abbreviation of a word starting with T. 'T-shirt' is clearly as least 300 years too late, has no connection with the meaning of the phrase and can't be taken as a serious contender.'T-square' has more going for it, in that a T-square is a precise drawing instrument, but also lacks any other evidence to link it to the phrase. The first letter of a word. If this is the derivation then the word in question is very likely to be 'tittle'. A tittle is a small stroke or point in writing or printing and is now best remembered via the term jot or tittle. The best reason for believing that this is the source of the 'T' is that the phrase 'to a tittle' existed in English more than a century before 'to a T', with the same meaning. For example, in Edward Hall's Chronicles, circa 1548, we find: "I then... began to dispute with my selfe, little considerynge that thus my earnest was turned euen to a tittyl not so good as, estamen."When there isn't a definitive origin and there are several proposed derivations, the wisest course is to list the possibilities and leave it at that. In this case, although there is no smoking gun, the 'to a tittle' derivation would probably stand up in court as 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

Curry favourMeaningTo attempt to gain favour or ingratiate oneself, by officious courtesy or flattery.OriginThe BBC is currently (August 2007) running a series of programmes to mark the 60th anniversary of the Partition of India. Given the popularity of Indian food in the UK they have included several cookery programmes and I have now heard the 'curry flavour' pun three times - and counting.On looking into the source of the originating 'curry favour' phrase (curry source? - now they've got me at it) it appears that it isn't original at all, but is itself a mishearing of another phrase. To disentangle 'curry favour', or as the Americans prefer it spelled 'curry favor', we need to look at 'curry' and 'favour' separately.The word curry denoting the spicy food comes from the Indian words 'kari' or 'karil' and was known in the English-speaking world by the late 16th century. A translation of Van Linschoten's His Discours of Voyages into ye Easte & West Indies, 1598, records that:"Most of their fish is eaten with rice, which they seeth in broth, which they put upon the rice, and is somewhat soure... but it tasteth well, and is called Carriel." To no great surprise, the curry of 'curry favour' has nothing to do with Indian food. It comes instead from an Old French verb conraier - 'to prepare', 'to put in order'. This is the same source as the name for the rubbing down and dressing of horses - curry-combing. The mishearing that gives us 'curry favour' is of the second word. This was originally not 'favour' but 'favel'. John Palsgrave's Lesclarcissement de la langue fran鏾yse [The clarification of the French language], 1530, records a curryfavell as 'a flatterar'.Favel comes from the 1310 poem by the French royal clerk Gervais du Bus - Roman de Fauvel [The Romance of Fauvel]. That morality tale relates the story of Fauvel, an ambitious and vain donkey, who deceives and corrupts the greedy leaders of church and state. The name Fauvel or Favvel, which is formed from 'fau-vel' (in English 'veiled lie'), is an acrostic made from the initial letters of a version of the seven deadly sins: flaterie (flattery/pride), avarice (greed/gluttony), vilanie (wrath), vari閠?(inconstancy), envie (envy), and lachet?(cowardice).In the poem, the rich and powerful humiliate themselves by bowing down and stroking the coat of the false leader, i.e. by 'currying Fauvel'. The first citation of 'curry favour' rather than 'curry Fauvel' comes in Alexander Barclay's, The mirrour of good manners, circa 1510:"Flatter not as do some, With none curry fauour."

A flash in the panMeaningSomething which disappoints by failing to deliver anything of value, despite a showy beginning.OriginThere's reason to believe that this phrase derives from the Californian Gold Rush of the mid 19th century. Prospectors who panned for gold supposedly became excited when they saw something glint in the pan, only to have their hopes dashed when it proved not to be gold but a mere 'flash in the pan'. This is an attractive and plausible notion, in part because it ties in with another phrase related to disappointment - 'it didn't pan out'. 'Panning out' can be traced to US prospectors and was used in that context by the early 20th century. For example, Paul Haworth's Trailmakers of the Northwest, 1921:"The Colonel had told them that a cubic foot of gravel would pan out twenty dollars in gold."Nevertheless, gold prospecting isn't the origin of 'a flash in the pan'. The phrase did have a literal meaning, i.e. it derives from a real flash in a real pan, but not a prospector's pan. Flintlock muskets used to have small pans to hold charges of gunpowder. An attempt to fire the musket in which the gunpowder flared up without a bullet being fired was a 'flash in the pan'.The term has been known since the late 17th century. Elkanah Settle, in Reflections on several of Mr. Dryden's plays 1687, had this to say:"If Cannons were so well bred in his Metaphor as only to flash in the Pan, I dare lay an even wager that Mr. Dryden durst venture to Sea." See also - lock, stock and barrel.

Run the gauntletMeaningTo go through a series of criticisms or harsh treatments at the hands of one's detractors.OriginGauntlets are familiar to us today as the stout leather gloves used for gardening and the like. Mediaeval gauntlets were made of even sterner stuff. They were gloves that formed part of a suit of armour. Gauntlets, or gantlettes, gauntelotes etc., were usually covered with plates of steel and were as useful for attack as for defence. When a dispute arose involving a member of the English nobility who was wealthy enough to own his own armour then he (it was always a he) would literally 'throw down the gauntlet' as a challenge. That phrase is first recorded in Hall's Chronicles of Richard III, 1548: "Makynge a proclamacion, that whosoeuer would saie that kynge Richard was not lawefully kynge, he woulde fighte with hym at the vtteraunce, and threwe downe his gauntlet."Another ancient custom of British fighting men was a form of punishment in which the culprit was made to run stripped to the waist between two rows of men who whipped and beat him as he passed by. These beatings were extremely severe and the victims often died as a result - and many of those that didn't may well have wished they had, as survivors were sometimes executed afterwards. This punishment is the source of the term 'running the gauntlet' and was used by both the British army and navy. It would be natural to assume that gauntlets were used in the beatings and that 'running the gauntlet' derived from that. In fact, that's not the case and neither the punishment nor the phrase have anything to do with gauntlets, either military or horticultural. The name of the brutal punishment was originally 'running the gantelope'. Gantlope is an Anglicised form of the Swedish word 'gatlop', or 'gatu-lop', which refers to the gate of soldiers that the victim had to pass through. The Ist Earl of Shaftsbury recorded the phrase in his Diary, 1646: "Three were condemned to die, two to run the gantelope."It didn't take long for gantlope to migrate into ganlet, or gauntlet - possibly as a result of a simple muddle over the similar-sounding words or possibly because of the association with the use of gauntlets as weapons and with the antagonism implicit in 'throwing down the gauntlet'. The earliest known record of the gantlet form of the phrase is in Joseph Glanvill's The vanity of dogmatizing, or confidence in opinions etc., 1661:"To print, is to run the gantlet, and to expose ones self to the tongues strapado."The first use of the currently used 'gauntlet' spelling comes from the intriguingly named Increase Mather, in The history of King Philip's war, 1676:"They stripped them naked, and caused them to run the Gauntlet."Some writers, recognising that 'gauntlet' was used in error, continued to use the 'gantelope' version into the 18th and 19th centuries - well after the word was archaic and otherwise unused. For example, Henry Fielding in The History of Tom Jones, a foundling , 1749:"Some said he ought to be tied neck and heels; others that he deserved to run the gantlope."Any such attempts are now long abandoned and we are left with a 'gauntlet' phrase that has nothing to do with gauntlets.

Caught red-handedMeaningTo be caught in the act of committing a misdemeanour, with the evidence there for all to see. OriginThe Red Hand has long been a heraldic and cultural symbol of the northern Irish province of Ulster. One of the many myths as to its origin is the tale of how, in a boat race in which the first to touch the shore of Ulster was to become the province's ruler, one contestant guaranteed his win by cutting off his hand and throwing it to the shore ahead of his rivals. The potency of the symbol remains and is used in the Ulster flag, and as recently as the 1970s a group of Ulster loyalist paramilitaries named themselves the Red Hand Commandos.Red-handed doesn't have a mythical origin however - it is a straightforward allusion to having blood on one's hands after the execution of a murder or a poaching session. The term originates, not from Northern Ireland, but from a country not far from there, i.e. Scotland. An earlier form of 'red-handed', simply 'red hand', dates back to a usage in the Scottish Acts of Parliament of James I, 1432. Red-hand appears in print many times in Scottish legal proceedings from the 15th century onward. For example, this piece from Sir George Mackenzie's A discourse upon the laws and customs of Scotland in matters criminal, 1674:"If he be not taken red-hand the sheriff cannot proceed against him."The earliest known printed version of 'red-handed' is from Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, 1819:"I did but tie one fellow, who was taken redhanded and in the fact, to the horns of a wild stag."Scott was an avid student of Scottish history and folklore, which he relentlessly mined for inspiration in his novel writing. He is certain to have heard 'redhand' before writing Ivanhoe. The step from 'redhand' to 'redhanded' isn't large, so calling Scott the originator of the term is perhaps being over generous to him. Nevertheless, the enormous popularity of his books certainly brought 'red-handed' to a wide audience and, without him, the term might now be long forgotten. 16th and 17th century Scottish sources provide various examples of 'apprehended redhand', 'taken with redhand' etc. but the earliest known citation of the currently used 'caught red-handed' phrase is in the English novelist George Alfred Lawrence's work Guy Livingstone; or, 'Thorough', 1857: My companion picked up the object; and we had just time to make out that it was a bell-handle and name-plate, when the pursuers came up - six or seven "peelers" and specials, with a ruck of men and boys. We were collared on the instant. The fact of the property being found in our possession constituted a 'flagrans delictum' - we were caught "red-handed." See also - phrases coined by Sir Walter Scott.

Prime timeMeaningThe time of day when the TV audience is at its largest. OriginWe now associate the term 'prime time' with TV ratings and advertising, i.e. the prime slot for the placing of TV adverts. In that context it originated in the USA soon after WWII. For example, this piece from The Wall Street Journal, January 1947:"Columbia Broadcasting System, for instance, has an unsold hour of prime time on Tuesday nights, beginning at 9:30."A prior usage of 'prime time' had been coined many centuries earlier, to mean Spring or 'at the beginning' (of the day, of life etc.). It is likely to have been inherited into English from the French word for Spring - Printemps. Geoffrey Chaucer used the term in the late 14th century, in his translation of the French lyric poem The Romance of the Rose:"Pryme temps full of frostes whit, And May devoide of al delit." By the 16th century, the Anglicization to 'prime time' was complete, as in this example from Edward Hall's The Union of the Noble and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre and York, 1548:"In ye pryme tyme of the yere he toke his iorney towardes Yorke." [In the Spring he took his journey to York] Many European languages have a form of 'prime' meaning 'first/primary', for example, 'prime', in English/Dutch/German, 'prim', in Swedish/Danish/Icelandic, 'prima', in Spanish/Portuguese/Italian etc. These all stem from the Latin 'prima' (first hour). In addition to the Chaucerian 'Spring', the Latin 'prima' was also the source of 'prime' as the name of the first of the canonical hours of prayer of the Catholic Church. This gave us a yet earlier meaning of 'prime time', i.e. 'early morning', the time when the first prayers were offered. Old English texts which include references to this 'prime' include The Rule of Saint Benedict, which dates from circa 530.

The whole shebangMeaningAll of it; the whole thing.OriginThis is an American phrase, from the 1920s. The first question for those of us not living in the USA, and I suspect quite a few that do, is, what's a shebang? That isn't so easy to answer. The earliest known citation of the word uses it as some form of hut or rustic dwelling. That's in Walt Whitman's Specimen Days, from Complete Poetry and Collected Prose, 1862: "Besides the hospitals, I also go occasionally on long tours through the camps, talking with the men, &c. Sometimes at night among the groups around the fires, in their shebang enclosures of bushes."Just a few years later, the Marysville Tribune, November 1869 printed a list of 'The Idioms of Our New West' and defined 'shebang' like this:"'Shebang' is applied to any sort of house or office."Soon after that, Mark Twain uses 'shebang' to refer to a form of vehicle - in Roughing It, 1872: "Take back your money, madam. We can't allow it. You're welcome to ride here as long as you please, but this shebang's chartered, and we can't let you pay a cent."There are various 'the whole' expressions which derive from America - 'the whole ball of wax', 'the whole nine yards', 'the whole box of dice', 'the whole shooting match', 'the whole enchilada', 'the whole kit and caboodle' etc. Whilst these by and large refer to real objects, none of them represent 'wholeness' and they have just been tacked on to 'the whole' to make catchy phrases. 'Shebang' was also used that way - and that the fact that people using it didn't know what a shebang was didn't really matter. It was simply a colourful way of saying 'thing'. The word appears to have arrived fully-formed in the 1860s. Prior to 1862, there are no examples in print. During the 1860s there are dozens of examples in US newspapers, literature etc. That 'vehicle' usage does suggest a possible link with the name for a form of early UK sightseeing bus, i.e. charabanc (pronounced sharra-bang). This derives from the French char-?bancs - carriage with benches. Charabancs, affectionately known to passengers as 'sharras', were a commonplace in Britain from the introduction of horse-drawn examples in the early 1800s to as late as the 1970s. Could 'shebang' be a variant of 'sharra-bang'? Well, it's certainly possible, although the evidence to support that view is entirely circumstantial. In June 1872, the same year that Twain was using 'shebang' to mean vehicle, the Sedalia Daily Democrat printed a piece which used the name just to mean 'thing', and this is the earliest example of 'the whole shebang':"Well, the Democracy can flax [beat up] the whole shebang, and we hope to see our party united."

The whole kit and caboodleMeaningA collection of things. OriginThe words kit and caboodle have rather similar meanings.A kit - is set of objects, as in a toolkit, or what a soldier would put in his kit-bag.A caboodle (or boodle) - is an archaic term meaning group or collection, usually of people.There are several phrases similar to the whole kit and caboodle, which is first recorded in that form in 1884. Most of them are of US origin and all the early citations are American. Caboodle was never in common use outside the USA and now has died out everywhere, apart from its use in this phrase. - The whole kit - the whole of a soldier's necessaries, the contents of his knapsack. From Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1785.- The whole kit and boodleAlthough this citation is slightly later than that of the final 'whole kit and caboodle', it's worth including as it gives a 19th-century version of the meaning of the term. It may still be a step along the way - either unrecorded before 1888 or recorded in an, as yet, undiscovered work. This piece, titled 'The Origin of Boodle', is from The Dunkirk Observer-Journal, New York, September 1888:"It is probably derived from the Old-English word bottel, a bunch or a bundle, as a bottel of straw. "The whole kit and boodle of them" is a New England expression in common use, and the word in this sense means the whole lot. Latterly, boodle has come to be somewhat synonymous with the word pile, the term in use at the gaming table, and signifying a quantity of money. In the gaming sense, when a man has "lost his boodle", he has lost his pile or whole lot of money, whatever amount he happened to have with him."- The whole kit and boiling (or bilin')Sinclair Lewis, in 'Main Street', 1920:"...and some of these college professors are just about as bad, the whole kit and bilin' of 'em are nothing in God's world but socialism in disguise!"- The whole (or whool) boodleFrom J. Neal's, 'Down-Easters', 1833:"I know a feller 'twould whip the whool boodle of 'em an' give 'em six."From Bangor Daily Whig And Courier, Maine, 1839:"A whole squad have got to permit to see you.Who are they?I don't know, a whole boodle of them."- The whole caboodleFrom the Ohio State Journal, 1848:"The whole caboodle will act upon the recommendation of the Ohio Sun."Which brings us finally to the whole kit and caboodleFrom the Syracuse Sunday Standard, New York, Nov, 1884:"More audiences have been disappointed by him and by the whole kit-and-caboodle of his rivals."It is most likely that these phrases were in use simultaneously and that there isn't a clear parentage of one to another. 'Kit and caboodle' had the advantage of the alliterative 'k' sound and that's doubtless why it has outlasted the others, which are now all fallen out of use. What we can't confirm is that the word caboodle migrated from boodle in order to sound better when matched with kit. It is possible that that's what happened, but the dates of the known citations don't support it. Whole kit and caboodle, (1884) is recorded before whole kit and boodle, (1888) and whole caboodle comes well before both, in 1848. Perhaps that's just the inadequacy or either records or research and that citations with the appropriate dates will emerge later.

The whole nine yardsMeaningAll of it - full measure.OriginOf all the feedback that The Phrase Finder site gets this is the phrase that is asked about the most often. At the outset it should be said that no one is 100% sure of the origin, although many have a fervent belief that they do. These convictions are unfailingly based on no more evidence than 'someone told me'. How was the phrase derived? "The whole nine yards" crops up in many contexts, which isn't surprising, as there are many things that can be measured in linear, square or cubic yards - and there are also yard-arms, steelyards etc. to account for. This is the source of the variability of the many plausible, but of course mostly incorrect, explanations of the phrase's origin. Regrettably, plausibility doesn't get us very far, as the following will show. The early citations of the phrase don't in fact refer to yards of any particular material, just to a non-specific measure - 'yards'. The most probable source of the phrase is the US military - that's where many early references to the phrase originate. The earliest such military reference is from the 1960s, in Elaine Shepard's novel about the Vietnam War - The Doom Pussy (A narrative about the Vietnam War and the men who are fighting it). The book was first published in 1967 and recounts army life during the early 1960s. The whole nine yards is used several times in the book, principally by the character Major 'Smash' Crandell. The first citation relates to his extracting himself from an unwanted marriage:The story began when he had absent-mindedly gone through a wedding ceremony a couple of years before while snockered one Saturday night in San Francisco. Slipping out of the knot was expensive but Smash was eventually able to untangle what he called "the whole nine yards."A later reference concerns a letter to a serviceman from a sweetheart, promising him comprehensive sexual favours when he gets back home. His response to this is:God. The first thing in the early pearly morning and the last thing at night. Beds all over the gahdam house. The whole nine yards.It is possible that the phrase was coined by servicemen in Vietnam. One possible source for this would be the Montagnard hill tribes, who were known by the US forces as 'the Yards'. In 1970, the US author Robert L. Mole published The Montagnards of South Vietnam: A Study of Nine Tribes. Some reports suggest that these nine tribes are the source of the 'nine' in TWNY; other US service memoirs claim that Special Operations Group teams consisted of three US soldiers and nine Yards. The disparity in these reports gives some cause for caution, but it could be that the phrase did originate in Vietnam and that Elaine Shepard picked it up as force's jargon while researching for her book.The military are also the source of the majority of hearsay accounts of the phrase's source. Many of these are of the 'I was there' variety and carry more authority than the usual, and frankly unhelpful, 'I was told' stories. Having spent some time researching this phrase I have received many such reports from servicemen (usually U.S. servicemen). One such example is from a U.S. drill sergeant who claims that the phrase originated in Fort Benning, Georgia, where soldiers were trained in the 'tree-second rush'. This involved running nine yards in three seconds before diving to ground to avoid sniper fire. Of all the explanations I've heard this one seems to me to be the most believable and certainly fits the phrase's meaning, although without documentary evidence it is just another plausible story. When was it coined?Although the precise derivation of a given slang phrase is often difficult to determine, the date of its coinage usually isn't. Phrases that are accepted into common use appear in newspapers, court reports, novels etc. very soon after they are coined and continue to do so for as long as the phrase is in use. Anyone who puts forward an explanation of an origin for 'the whole nine yards' which dates it to before the 1950s has to explain the lack of a printed record of it prior to 1954. If, to take the most commonly repeated version for instance, the phrase comes from the length of WWII machine gun belts, why is there no printed account of that in the thousands of books written about the war and the countless millions of newspaper editions published throughout the 1950s and 60s? The idea that it pre-dates the war and goes back to the 19th century or even the Middle Ages is even less plausible. What I am sure of is that the phrase wasn't in wide circulation before 1961 - which tends to rule out many of the suggested sources. Why? In May 1961, the American athlete Ralph Boston broke the world long jump record with a jump of 27 feet 1/2 inch. No one had previously jumped 27 feet. This was big news at the time and widely reported. Surely the feat cried out for this headline?:"Boston goes the whole nine yards"And yet, not a single journalist worldwide came up with that line, which is missing from all newspaper archives. The phrase may have been coined before 1961, but it certainly wasn't then known to that most slang-aware of groups - newspaper journalists. The likelihood that the phrase originated in the mid 20th century is supported by the lack of any evidence prior to the early 1960s and the ample printed citations from the late 1960s. "The whole nine yards" was in wide enough circulation in the USA then for it to be appearing in newspaper adverts. There are many examples of this, as here from the Playground Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, 1st May 1969:'Four bedroom home, located in Country Club Estates. Running distance from Golf Course. Completed and ready to move in. This home has "the whole nine yards" in convenience.' Earliest citations in print The earliest known example of the phrase in print is in The Agitator, 29th March 1855. This newspaper, based in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, claimed to be 'Devoted to the Extension of the Area of Freedom and the Spread of Healthy Reform'. Despite that claim, the paper's content consists of made-up stories of the 'WWII bomber found on the moon' sort we see in our contemporary gutter press. The story from 1855 concerns a judge who arrived at an event without a spare shirt and decided to have one made for him. As a joke a friend ordered one with three times the required material, i.e. 'nine yards of bleached domestic and three yards of linen'. The outcome was:"He found himself shrouded in a shirt five yards long and four yards broad. What a silly, stupid woman! I told her to get enough to make three shirts; instead of making three, she has put the whole nine yards into one shirt!"Well, that does contain the phrase in question and it does relate to yards of material, which is one of the commonly repeated origins. This appears to be by pure chance though. After all, the individual words are common enough and have to appear together arbitrarily sometimes. This can't be accepted as the origin.To get a more plausible source we have to come forward to as recent a date as 1964, which is the earliest date I've yet found for the 'whole thing' meaning of the expression. On 18th of April that year, the Texas newspaper The San Antonio Express and News reprinted an article headed How To Talk 'Rocket', by Stephen Trumbull. He wrote the piece for The World Book Encyclopedia Science Service and it lists and explains new jargon terms that were in use in the space exploration community in the USA. He offered the opinion that "the new language spreads across the country - like a good joke - with amazing rapidity", which suggests that the terms listed were recently coined and went on the write:"Give 'em the whole nine yards" means an item-by-item report on any project.Whether the term actually originated as spaceman's jargon is open to doubt. It could easily have been appropriated by them from another source. That source could well have been the US military, as that's where many early references to the phrase originate.Suggested derivations Despite being sure they are all inventions, I'm obliged to include some of the versions of the source of the phrase that are going the rounds. Take your pick, and feel free to make up your own, everyone else does:It comes from the nine cubic yards capacity of US concrete trucks and dates from around 1970s. Widely circulated although arrant nonsense as even the largest concrete mixers were smaller than 9 cubic yards in 1967.The explanation refers to World War II aircraft, which if proved correct would clearly predate the concrete truck version. There are several aircraft related sources:The length of US bombers bomb racks. The length of RAF Spitfire's machine gun bullet belts. The length of ammunition belts in ground based anti-aircraft turrets, etc. No evidence to show that any of these measured nine yards has been forthcoming.Tailors use nine yards of material for top quality suits. Related to 'dressed to the nines'?The derivation has even been suggested as being naval and that the yards are shipyards rather than measures of area or volume. Another naval version is that the yards are yardarms. Large sailing ships had three masts, each with three yardarms. The theory goes that ships in battle can continue changing direction as new sails are unfurled. Only when the last sail, on the ninth yardarm, is used do the enemy know which direction the ship is finally headed.A mediaeval test requiring the victim to walk nine paces over hot coals. If anyone has any hard evidence of this phrase being used before 1964, e.g. an appearance of the phrase in print, I would love to see it. Please post your feedback at the Phrase Finder Discussion Forum - but please, evidence not conjecture.

Barking madMeaningInsane; intensely mad.OriginThere are a couple of stories which link 'barking mad' with the east London suburb of Barking. One is that the phrase owes its origin to a mediaeval asylum for the insane which was part of Barking Abbey. The second story isn't a suggested origin, just a neat 1980s joke at the expense of Margaret Thatcher. She was known by those who disliked her as 'Daggers' Thatcher - not from a reputation for stabbing colleagues in the back, but because she was said to be 'three stops past Barking'. [Dagenham is three stations beyond Barking on the London Underground] The problem with the asylum tale is the date - it is far too early. 'Barking mad' isn't mediaeval and began to appear in the language only around the beginning of the 20th century. The first record of it that I can find in print is from the USA. The 11th November 1927 edition of the Oklahoma newspaper The Ada Evening News reported on the frenetic and, if contemporary photographs are to be believed, borderline insane sport of Auto-polo:"At 2:30 this afternoon at Park field a half dozen barking mad auto polo cars will be whirled into action."That usage suggests a readership who were already familiar with the phrase, and the playing of polo in cars, while having a strong claim to epitomise madness, isn't the likely source. A much more prosaic derivation, that the phrase refers to mad and possibly rabid dogs, is a more probable source. There are many examples of 'barking like a mad dog' in print. For example, this from records of the trial for murder of a Walter Tricker, in 1867:Mrs Hitchins, at the Inquest, says 'It was not ordinary barking. They [the dogs] were barking like tearing mad.' See also: barking up the wrong tree; as mad as a hatter.

Top dog MeaningOne who is dominant or victorious. Origin'Top dog' is synonymous with the similar, if now archaic, phrases, 'upper dog' and 'over dog'. It is also the antonym of 'under dog' (now usually spelled as a single word) and its archaic synonym, 'bottom dog'.We have here a golden opportunity for those who consider plausibility to be enough evidence to hang a phrase derivation on and the following explanation has been widely repeated. When wooden planks were sawn by hand, two men did the job using a two-handed saw. The senior man took the top handle, standing on the wood, and the junior took the bottom, in the saw-pit below. Add to this the fact that the irons that were used to hold the wood were called dogs and that the bottom position was much the more uncomfortable, and we can jump from this scene to the origin of 'top dog' and 'underdog'.That may be true. The problem with it as an explanation is that no one has found evidence to back it up. There are printed references to saw-pits and to this form of work going back to the early 15th century in England and the 19th century in America. None of these make any mention of 'top dog' or 'under dog'. It is hardly likely that everyone, including Shakespeare, who referred to saw-pits in The Merry Wives of Windsor, would have ignored these colourful phrases had they been in use at the time. For example, this extract from the 1876 Yale Review describes saw-pits in some detail makes no mention of 'top dog':"The saw-pit was a rude structure about seven feet high, made of strong posts set in the ground wide enough apart to hold one or two pieces of heavy pine timber, and the sawyers, one above and one beneath, sawed out one hundred feet per day."In fact, there are no known references to 'top dog' or 'under dog' in the context of wood sawing until well after the practise was superseded by mechanical sawing.What citations there are to these terms that date from the days that the pits were still in use all refer to fights of some sort, particularly dog fights. Here's a piece, for which the word doggerel might have been invented, that appeared in several US newspapers in 1859, under the name of David Barker:The Under Dog In The FightBut for me - and I care not a single figIf they say I am wrong or right wrong,I shall always go for the weaker dog,For the under dog in the fight.I know that the world, that the great big world,Will never a moment stop.To see which dog may be in the fault,But will shout for the dog on top.The earliest record that I can find of a figurative use of 'top dog' is a 20th century one, in The Speaker; a review of politics etc., 1900: "The most popular argument in favour of the war is that it will make the individual Briton top dog in South Africa."There are several earlier examples of a related phrase - 'tip-top dog' and these all relate to actual prize fighting or hunting dogs. For example, from The Sporting Review, 1840:"Even a good judge may be unable to form an accurate estimate of a dog's olfactory powers, Should there be no tip-top dog at hand to compare with, the only other criterion ... is the manner of finding game." The move from 'tip-top dog' to 'top dog' is quite easy to accept and, while the saw-pit theory as the origin of 'top dog' and 'under dog' is attractive, the complete lack of evidence to support it renders it as mere speculation. There appears to be little reason to doubt that 'top dog' had a literal derivation - 'a dog that is top'. See also: the Nonsense Nine.

Toe the lineMeaningTo conform to an established standard or political programme. OriginThere is some confusion between 'toe the line' and the frequently seen misspelling 'tow the line'. The 'tow' version is no doubt encouraged by the fact that ropes or cables on ships are often called lines and that 'tow lines' are commonplace nautical items. The earlier meaning of 'to toe the line' was to position one's toes next to a marked line in order to be ready to start a race, or some other undertaking. In the 19th century, we wouldn't have been limited to lines when it came to placing our feet, but would have had a choice of what to toe - a mark, scratch, crack or trig [a line or small trench]. These were all then in use in 'toe the ...' phrases. The earliest version we know about is from The Diverting History of John Bull and Brother Jonathan, 1813, by 'Hector Bull-Us' - known to his family and friends as James Paulding:"He began to think it was high time to toe the mark."Pauling was using the figurative rather than literal meaning of the phrase, i.e. to 'toe the mark' was to conform to a set standard. Going back to the original, literal 'toeing' of a line; there are many circumstances where one might place one's toes up to a line - the start of a sporting event, standing in formation on parade, etc, etc. So, which is the source of the phrase? One explanation that is often repeated is that the phrase derives from the British House of Commons. Arguments in the House are often heated. To deter members of opposing parties from attacking each other, two parallel red lines are marked, two sword-lengths apart, on the floor of the house. MPs are expected to stay behind these lines when a speech is in progress. Members, of course, no longer carry swords, but the tradition remains. Visitors to the House of Commons are very likely to hear this tale related by a tour guide. Counting against this supposed derivation is the fact that the current Commons Chamber dates from only 1950, when the building was rebuilt following WWII bomb damage. Paintings of earlier Commons chambers, from the times when members might actually have worn swords, show no such lines. The parliamentary link may be strengthened in some people's minds because of the 'toe the party line' usage, which relates to orthodoxy in politics. Another possible source is prizefighting. The scratch was the line marked across the ring in early 'toe-to-toe' boxing bouts. Anyone man enough to enter into such a contest was 'up to scratch' (see also: start from scratch). This version of the phrase was known in the USA by the early 19th century, for example, this piece from the Gettysburg newspaper The Peoples Press, from October 1835, in which the public was invited to put up or shut up in a wager about an election:Come gentlemen "toe the scratch" or hereafter forever hold your peace.Other early examples of 'toe the ...' have a nautical connection. In the 19th century, sailors were expected to prepare themselves for group punishment by standing in formation on deck and 'toeing the line' between boards - also called 'toeing the crack'. This usage is the earliest that I've found for 'toe the line' in print - from The Edinburgh Literary Journal, January - June 1831:"The matter, therefore, necessarily became rather serious; and the whole gang of us being sent for on the quarter-deck, we were ranged in a line, each with his toes at the edge of a plank, according to the orthodox fashion of these gregarious scoldings, technically called toe-the-line matches."Which is the source? Well, no one knows. What is for certain - it is toe, not tow.

In the pinkMeaningIn perfect condition, especially of health.OriginThe general usage of this phrase has altered somewhat since it first entered the language. We now usually see it with the specific meaning of 'the pink of condition', i.e. in the best possible health. It is tempting but, as it turns out, misguided, to assume an association between 'the pink of condition' and the healthily glowing pink cheeks of new-born babies or energetic sportsmen/sportswomen and the like. The earliest citations of 'in the pink' are from the 16th century and, at that time, the meaning was 'the very pinnacle of something', but not necessarily limited to health. The earliest example that I can find of pink being used with that meaning is from 1597 Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, 1597:Mercurio: Why, I am the very pinke of curtesie.The earliest citation I've found for 'in the pink' is from Leigh's Kensington Gardens, 1720:"'Tis the Pink of the Mode, to marry at first Sight: - And some, indeed, marry without any Sight at all."It isn't until the 20th century that we find the phrase in the 'pink of condition' form that is currently used, in the Kynoch Journal, 1905:"Makers may despatch explosives from the factory in the pink of condition."So, what's special about pink? The association of the phrase 'in the pink' with the so-called pink jackets worn by the UK fox-hunting aficionados is unproven. The jackets, which are in fact scarlet, have been said to have derived their 'hunting pink' name from a tailor called Thomas Pink and that 'in the pink' refers to both the jackets and to the healthy, energetic approach to the pastime that many hunters adopt. Fox-hunters can be said to be literally in the pink but the hunting derivation is nevertheless far-fetched. There are no historical records of any such Thomas Pink and his association with the fox-hunting fraternity wasn't suggested until long after the first references to pink jackets. Why pink has been chosen to epitomise the pinnacle of quality is more likely to do with the Dianthus flower, many varieties of which are called Pinks. It is known that society in the reign of Elizabeth I admired the flowers, hence the first uses of pink with the 'excellent' meaning in that period. What is interesting to speculate on is why the flowers were called Pinks. You may think that a silly question, as Dianthuses are almost always pink in colour. There are two quite believable theories. One suggests that it is the flowers that gave their name to the colour, rather than vice-versa, and that the name derives from the Dutch 'pinck-ooghen' - 'little eye' (literally - to blink). The second theory is based on the earlier verb form of pink, which means to cut or to pierce material - in a style that would now be done using pinking shears. Dianthuses are said to be called Pinks because their edges are pinked. Take your choice.

On the warpathMeaningIntent on a confrontation or fight. Origin'War path' was originally written as two words and, following the usual hyphenation phase, i.e. as 'war-path', it is now more commonly seen as the single word 'warpath'. The 'war path' was the literal 'path to war' taken by native Americans (who were variously referred to in early citations of this phrase as Indians, red-skins or savages) when travelling to an enemy's territory to engage in battle. In America in So Many Words, 1997, Metcalf and Barnhart state that the name was used in 1755 on 'a map' - "Canoes may come up to the Crossing of the War Path". Unfortunately, they don't cite their source, although the book is well-researched and I've no reason to doubt their assertion. The phrase was unquestionably in use in the USA twenty years later, when James Adair included it in The history of the American Indians, 1775 and qualifies as one of the very earliest American phrases:"I often have rode that war path alone."The 'war path' was also sometimes called the 'warrior's path', as in A Sketch of the History of Wyoming, by Isaac Chapman, 1830:"He commenced his march by way of Fort Allen on the Lehigh near the Water-gap, and thence by the warrior's path to Wyoming."It took a little while for the phrase to take on its present-day figurative meaning. The process of change from the literal began with this simile in the Cyclopaedia of Wit and Humor, by William Burton, 1859:"Tell not such a tale to the seaman,... nor to the author,... publishing at his own cost, the critics, like savages, come out on the war path, track him by the print he makes, and then scalp him."The process was complete by 1880, when Mark Twain (S. L. Clemens) used the phrase with no Indians in sight, in the travelogue A tramp abroad:"She was on the war path all the evening."The phrase is still used when tribes go to war, as in the recent (September, 2007) 'Microsoft on the warpath' headlines that were used to report the so-called 'Portal wars' between Microsoft and Google.

Three sheets to the windMeaningVery drunk.OriginOur colleagues at CANOE, the Committee to Ascribe a Nautical Origin to Everything, have been hard at work and, to their great pleasure, they can add this phrase to their list. 'Three sheets to the wind' is indeed a seafaring expression. To understand this phrase we need to enter the arcane world of nautical terminology. Sailors' language is, unsurprisingly, all at sea and many supposed derivations have to go by the board. Don't be taken aback to hear that sheets aren't sails, as landlubbers might expect, but ropes (or occasionally, chains). These are fixed to the lower corners of sails, to hold them in place. If three sheets are loose and blowing about in the wind then the sails will flap and the boat will lurch about like a drunken sailor.The phrase is these days more often given as 'three sheets to the wind', rather than the original 'three sheets in the wind'. The earliest printed citation that I can find is in Pierce Egan's Real Life in London, 1821:"Old Wax and Bristles is about three sheets in the wind."Sailors at that time had a sliding scale of drunkenness; three sheets was the falling over stage; tipsy was just 'one sheet in the wind', or 'a sheet in the wind's eye'. An example appears in the novel The Fisher's Daughter, by Catherine Ward, 1824:"Wolf replenished his glass at the request of Mr. Blust, who, instead of being one sheet in the wind, was likely to get to three before he took his departure."Robert Louis Stevenson was as instrumental in inventing the imagery of 'yo ho ho and a bottle of rum' piracy as his countryman and contemporary Sir Walter Scott was in inventing the tartan and shortbread 'Bonnie Scotland'. Stevenson used the 'tipsy' version of the phrase in Treasure Island, 1883 - the book that gave us 'X marks the spot', 'shiver me timbers' and the archetypal one-legged, parrot-carrying pirate, Long John Silver. He gave Silver the line:"Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind's eye. But I'll tell you I was sober; "

The living daylightsMeaningA person's eyes; more recently, the life force or consciousness. OriginThe release of the 1987 film The Living Daylights, the fifteenth in the James Bond series, reawakened usage of this old phrase. When we refer to someone having the living daylights beaten, scared, or knocked out of them, we just mean that they have been badly beaten or scared, or knocked unconscious. The imagery is of someone being so discomforted as to lose the power of sight. Like similar phrases, for example 'beat the stuffing out of', the phrase is often used with an air of exaggeration and not always meant to be taken literally. The original 18th century meaning of 'daylights' was quite specific and literal; it meant 'the eyes'. That meaning is now long forgotten and few people are aware of it. The word was occasionally used to denote other items to do with seeing - spectacles, windows etc. (see daylight robbery), but usage of 'daylights' was largely limited to the eyes and to threats to close them by force. The first known citation of the word is one such example; in Henry Fielding's novel Amelia, 1752:"Good woman! I don't use to be so treated. If the lady says such another word to me, d--n me, I will darken her daylights."Francis Grose, in A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1796, reinforces the pugilistic usage: "Plump his peepers, or daylights; give him a blow in the eyes."The 'eyes' meaning of the word was going out of use even in the 19th century, hence the emergence then of 'knocking or beating the daylights out of someone'. The phrase is intended to indicate a severe beating, but perhaps not literally that severe. The lack of appreciation of the 'eyes' meaning led to the later 'beat the living daylight' variant. When referring to eyes, 'daylights' makes sense, whereas the singular 'daylight' doesn't, unless the intent is to punch only one eye that is. The first usage of 'beating the daylights out' that I can find is in Augustus Peirce's poem The Rebelliad, 1842:The people used to turn about,And knock the rulers' daylights out By the time that the intensifier 'living' was added, the phrase had lost all association with eyes. The earliest known version of that form was printed in several US newspapers in the 1890s, for example, The Decatur Morning Review, September 1890:"'I'm not going to be insulted by a miserable rabbit', and he started to club the living daylights out of the beast with his gun."The 20th century version of the phrase is the American 'punch someone's lights out'. The precursor to this form of the phrase was a widely syndicated newspaper report of the 1956 fight between Sugar Ray Robinson and Carl (Bobo) Olson: "Robinson's knockout punch turned out the lights for Bobo in the second round."

Keep the ball rollingMeaningMaintain a level of activity in and enthusiasm for a project. OriginThe American expression 'keep the ball rolling' was preceded by the similar, now archaic, British phrase 'keep the ball up'. They had much the same meaning, the earlier one alludes to keeping a ball in the air, i.e. conveying the notion of keeping an activity going. This was used figuratively by the radical social philosopher Jeremy Bentham, in a letter to George Wilson in 1781, referring to his efforts to keep a conversation going:"I put a word in now and then to keep the ball up." Bentham may be long dead but continues to be radical. He didn't opt for the traditional coffin, buried six feet under, but willed that his body be stuffed, mounted and put on display. It is exhibited in a cabinet at University College, London (although the severed head has now been removed). As a student at the University in the 1960s I was one of many who took the opportunity to open the cabinet doors to see Bentham peering back through the waxy glass - quite disconcerting. The 'keep the ball rolling' version of the phrase owes its origin and popularity to the US presidential election of July 1840. That election is widely regarded as introducing all the paraphernalia of present-day elections, i.e. campaign songs, advertising slogans and publicity stunts of all kinds. The unpopular incumbent President Martin Van Buren was pitted against Whig candidates, General William Harrison, a war hero who had fought against the Shawnee Indians at Tippecanoe, and John Tyler. The Whig candidates revelled in a folksy 'cider-drinking, log-cabin, men of the people' image and adopted the first known political slogan - 'Tippecanoe and Tyler, too'. A song of the same name was considered to have sung Harrison into the presidency:Don't you hear from every quarter, quarter, quarter,Good news and true,That swift the ball is rolling onFor Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.Harrison's campaign literature referred to Victory Balls. These weren't, as we might expect, dance parties that celebrated his famous victory, but ten-foot diameter globes made of tin and leather, which were pushed from one campaign rally to the next. His supporters were invited to attend rallies and push the ball on to the next town, chanting 'keep the ball rolling'.

Red herringMeaningA deliberate misleading and diverting of attention from the real issue. OriginRed herrings are salted herrings that turn a reddish colour during the smoking process. They have come to be synonymous with the deliberate false trails that are the stock in trade of 'who done it' thrillers. The term has been used to refer to people as well as to fish for some centuries. John Heywood's 1546 glossary, A dialogue conteinyng the nomber in effect of all the prouerbes in the Englishe tongue includes the expression: She is nother fyshe nor fleshe, nor good red hearyng.Fish was eaten by the clergy, flesh by the rich and the dried and smoked herrings by the poor. So this list of the foods eaten by all classes of society was a metaphor for 'encompassing all eventualities'.How do we move from the actual herrings in that expression to the figurative 'throwing off the scent' meaning? One theory has it that the meaning derives from the practice of using the oily and smelly herrings to lay false trails for hunting dogs. This practice is well documented from as far back as the late 1600s and Nicholas Cox's The Sportsman's Dictionary: Or The Gentleman's Companion, 1686 describes it: "The trailing or dragging of a dead Cat, or Fox, (and in case of necessity a Red-Herring) three or four miles... and then laying the Dogs on the scent."It seems implausible that people laid false 'fishy' trails in order to deceive hounds so that their prey would escape. After all, there was no hunt saboteur movement in 1686, and who would have a motive to do that? It's more likely that the use of red herrings was a training exercise, intended to put the hounds on the scent rather than to throw them off it. Nevertheless, the laying of a scent trail for dogs does establish the linguistic 'surrogate' meaning for 'red herring' and the further step to 'deliberate deceit' isn't a large one. Another theory is that the meaning derives from a trick played on one of his servants by the wealthy English clergyman Jasper Mayne. Mayne died in 1672 and willed large sums for the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral and to the poor people of his parishes of Cassington and Pyrton. He also willed to a servant "Somewhat that would make him Drink after his Death", which was left in a large trunk. When the trunk was opened the servant was disappointed to find that the bequest turned out to be a salted herring. The will doesn't mention a 'red herring', but a report of the event in Jacob's Poetical Register, 1719, does, so we can date the 'false representation' meaning to that date at the latest. Of the two theories, the Mayne story seems the more compelling. It introduces the idea of a deliberate misdirection, which, unless we are to believe that people deliberately misdirected hounds, the other lacks. Whatever the source, the figurative usage of the phrase was well established in UK by the early 1800s and had migrated to the USA by the middle of the century, as in this example from The New York Times, in May 1864:But when the Emperor found that England would not join him in a war, he cleverly started the "red herring" of the Congress which he knew well enough was out of the question, but which has admirably answered his purpose of creating a diversion.

Grass upMeaningInform on someone to the police.OriginIn 2005, British newspapers picked up on a story about a burglar who had stolen cash, jewellery and an African Grey parrot from a house near Hungerford, Berkshire. David Carlile, widely described in the press as 'feather-brained', explained to the police that he knew that African Greys could talk and he didn't want the bird to 'grass him up'. Presumably, had the parrot been a Norwegian Blue, he would have left it to pine for the fiords. 'Grassing up' has been a commonly used expression in the UK since the mid 20th century, but is less common elsewhere. The first known use of 'grass' in that context is Arthur Gardner's Tinker's Kitchen, 1932, which defined a grass as "an informer". Grass was a well-enough established word in the 1980s to have spawned 'supergrass', i.e. a republican sympathiser who later 'turned Queen's evidence' and informed on the IRA, and which gave the Brit-pop band Supergrass their name in the 1990s.Informers are variously known as squealers, noses, moles, snouts and stool pigeons. These terms invoke imagery of covert snooping around and of talking. Grass is less intuitive. It could just have arisen from 'snake in the grass', which derives from the writings of Virgil (in Latin, as 'latet anguis in herba') and has been known in English, meaning traitor, since the late 17th century. There is another route to the word and this is via rhyming slang. Farmer and Henley's 1893 Dictionary of Slang defines 'grasshopper' as 'copper', i.e. policeman. The theory is that a 'grass' is someone who works for the police and so has become a surrogate 'copper'. The rhyming slang link was certainly believed in 1950 by the lexicographer Paul Tempest, when he wrote Lag's lexicon: a comprehensive dictionary and encyclopaedia of the English prison to-day:"Grasser. One who gives information. A 'squealer? or 憇queaker'. The origin derives from rhyming slang: grasshopper - copper; a 'grass' or 'grasser' tells the 'copper' or policeman."That comes only a few years after the term grass was coined and there seems little reason to doubt it as the derivation. The original users of the term 'grass up' were from the London underworld and would have certainly been better acquainted with rhyming slang than the works of Virgil. Some have also theorised that the term 'shop', meaning 'give information that leads to an arrest', derives from the same source, i.e. that, as 'grass' derives from 'grasshopper', then so does 'shopper'. The earliest known use of shop in that context dates from around the same time as the emergence of grasshopper. The issue of the magazine Tit-Bits for May, 1899 includes:"[He] volunteered for a fiver to 'shop' his pals."As far as we know, African Greys don't go shopping.

On cloud nineMeaningIn a state of blissful happiness.OriginWhenever a phrase includes a number, like the whole nine yards, at sixes and sevens etc., then attempts to find its derivation usually focus on the number. 'On cloud nine' is no exception. A commonly heard explanation is that the expression originated as one of the classifications of cloud which were defined by the US Weather Bureau in the 1950s, in which 'Cloud Nine' denotes the fluffy cumulonimbus type that are considered so attractive. Another explanation is that the phrase derives from Buddhism and that Cloud Nine is one of the stages of the progress to enlightenment of a Bodhisattva (one destined to become a Buddha). Neither of these explanations holds water. To begin with, both the cloud classifications and the Buddhist stages to enlightenment have ten levels. To single out the last but one stage of either is rather like attributing the source of the 'whole nine yards' to American Football, where it is ten yards rather than nine that is a significant measure. Also, the fact that nine is far from the only number that has been linked with clouds, argues against those origins. Early examples of 'cloud' expressions include clouds seven, eight, nine and even thirty-nine. It seems that it is the clouds themselves, rather than the number of them, that were in the thoughts of those who coined this phrase. The imagery was originally of a 'cloud cuckoo land' or 'head in the clouds' dreaminess, induced by either intoxication or inspiration, rather than the 'idyllic happiness' that we now associate with the phrase. The early references all come from mid 20th century USA and the earliest that I've found is in Albin Pollock's directory of slang, The Underworld Speaks, 1935:"Cloud eight, befuddled on account of drinking too much liquor." 'Cloud nine' comes a little later, for example, in The Oxnard Press-Courier, August 1946:"I think he has thought of everything, unless the authorities pull something new on him out of cloud nine."Around the same period we find clouds seven and thirty-nine, in The San Mateo Times, April 1952 and Ross抯 Hustlers, 1956, respectively:"Mantovani's skilled use of reeds and strings puts this disc way up on Cloud Seven.""That stuff is way up on Cloud Thirty-nine."The early favourite was 'cloud seven' and many of the oldest citations use that form, as in this piece from The Dictionary of American Slang, 1960, which was the first printed definition of the term "Cloud seven - completely happy, perfectly satisfied; in a euphoric state." This early preference for seven as the significant number may have been influenced by the existing phrase 'seventh heaven'.Since the 1980s or so, 'cloud nine' has become predominant. Linguistic hype being what it is, we now hear people expressing their happiness with the inflationary 'cloud ten', which brings us back to the cumulonimbus/Buddhist theories. Eighth heaven anyone?

Spelling-beeMeaningA spelling contest.OriginThe term 'bee' has been used in the USA with the meaning of 'gathering', either for work, pleasure or competition, since the mid 18th century. The first such usage was the name 'spinning-bee', as in this example from The Boston Gazette, 1769:"Last Thursday about twenty young Ladies met at the house of Mr. L. on purpose for a Spinning Match; (or what is called in the Country a Bee)."Bees got their name by quite a roundabout route. The Middle English word for a prayer was a 'bene', from which we derive words like 'benefit'. This migrated to 'boon', with the meaning of 'a favour granted'. The English Dialect Dictionary, 1905, records the country term 'boon' as meaning "voluntary help, given to a farmer by his neighbours, in time of harvest, haymaking, etc". Migrants from England to the USA would have taken the term 'boon', which was also spelled 'been' or 'bean', with them. Communal activities were an essential ingredient of survival in frontier America and the word would certainly have been called on there. The imagery of the social and industrious nature of bees was sufficient to change 'beens' into 'bees'. Many of the activities where people congregated to undertake communal work became known as bees of one sort or another - 'husking-bees', 'quilting-bees', 'barn-raising-bees'. A less pleasant form of assembly was the hanging or lynching bee. A reference to such was made in The Fort Wayne Weekly Sentinel in August 1874. The paper reported a story of an incident in Maysville, Indiana, in which a case of mistaken identity almost resulted in a lynching:"And he came very near being the chief attraction at a Lynching Bee."The best-known 'bee', and the one that remains in common use, is the 'spelling bee'. Such events were originally called simply 'spelling-matches' but, being social gatherings, they came to be referred to as 'spelling-bees' by the early 19th century. The first reference I can find to the expression 'spelling-bee' in print is in The Knickerbocker, or New-York Monthly Magazine, April 1850:"Those who have attended a 'spelling-bee' - and what reader who ever went to a district-school in the country but has attended them?"It is clear that the term was well-established by 1850, as the citation suggests that the tests had then been in use for some years. Sometimes the tests were simply called 'spellings' rather than 'spelling-bees'; for example, this line from Oscar L. Jackson's 1860 reminiscences The Colonel's Diary:"The boys were anxious for a spelling in the evening."The popularity of spelling-bees in the USA was partly due to literacy being encouraged as a patriotic duty and partly to the widespread use of Noah Webster's American Spelling Book, which was first published in 1783. Webster is now best known for his American Dictionary of the English Language, but his spelling book, popularly known as the Blue-backed Speller, has possibly been more influential. This report from The Decatur Daily Review, May 1899, acknowledges Webster's significance: "After the regular business meeting of the Baptist Senior Endeavor society Monday night the members put aside dull care for an hour and had fun with the English language in an old fashioned spelling bee. If the ghost of Noah Webster was watching the scene he probably congratulated himself that he had not lived in vain."

Get down to brass tacksMeaningEngage with the basic facts or realities.OriginThe figurative expression 'getting down to brass tacks' isn't particularly old as phrases go. Its first known appearance, in the USA in 1863, was in the Texas newspaper The Tri-Weekly Telegraph:"When you come down to 'brass tacks' - if we may be allowed the expression - everybody is governed by selfishness."All of the other known early citations either originate in, or refer to, Texas. It is reasonable to assume that the phrase was coined there, in or about the 1860s. The derivation of 'getting down to brass tacks' is uncertain. Nevertheless, it is a phrase that is often asked about, so I will list the most likely possible sources and the evidence for and against them and leave you to make up your mind for yourself. Brass tacks are, of course, real as well as figurative items and two of the most commonly repeated supposed derivations refer to actual tacks. Firstly, there's the use of brass-headed nails as fabric fixings in the furniture trade, chosen on account of their decorative appearance and imperviousness to rust. Such brass tacks were commonly used in Tudor furniture and long predate the use of the phrase, which would tend to argue against that usage as the origin - why wait hundreds of years and then coin the phrase from that source? The supporters of that idea say that, in order to re-upholster a chair, the upholsterer would need first to remove all the tacks and fabric coverings, thus getting down to the basic frame of the chair. While that is true, it hardly seems to match the meaning of the expression, as the tacks would be the first thing to be removed rather than the last.The second explanation that relies on actual tacks comes from the haberdashery trade. Here the notion is that, in order to be more accurate than the rough-and-ready measuring of a yard of material by holding it out along an arm's length, cloth was measured between brass tacks which were set into a shop's counter. Such simple measuring devices were in use in the late 19th century, as is shown by this piece from Ernest Ingersoll's story The Metropolis of the Rocky Mountains, 1880:"I hurried over to Seabright抯. There was a little square counter, heaped with calicoes and other gear, except a small space clear for measuring, with the yards tacked off with brass tacks."Various other explanations relate to the tacks in boots, those that were put on chairs as a prank, the rivets on boats etc, etc. None of these come equipped with any real evidence and are best left alone.Of the supposed explanations that don't have literal allusions, we can rule out links with any form of 'brass tax'. There have been taxes on brass at various times, but no one can find any connection with this phrase. 'Getting down to brass tax' appears to be just a misspelling. The expression is also often said to be an example of Cockney rhyming slang, meaning 'facts'. In the strange world of Cockney argot, 'tacks' does indeed rhyme with 'facts' (facks), but that's as far as it goes. Rhyming slang coinages from the 19th century are limited to the UK and Australia. The apparent US origin of the phrase discounts the rhyming slang origin.For my money, the 'fabric measuring' derivation is the strongest candidate but, given no smoking gun, we await further evidence.

Cooking the booksMeaningThe deliberate distorting of a firm's financial accounts, often with the aim of avoiding the payment of tax. OriginCooking seems a rather odd choice of word to convey fraud. The Oxford English Dictionary lists a dozen or so meanings of the verb cook, ranging from 'prepare opium for use' to 'make the call of a cuckoo' and, of course, 'prepare food by the action of heat'. Tucked away at the bottom there is also the meaning - 'present in a surreptitiously altered form' and it is that use of cook that was used in the coinage of the phrase. The allusion appears to be the changing of one thing into another, as in the conversion of food ingredients into meals. This usage dates back to Tudor England and it was used by the Earl of Strafford in his Letters and dispatches, 1636:"The Proof was once clear, however they have cook'd it since."The verb was in common use by the 18th century and its meaning was used explicitly with regard to finance in Tobias Smollett's The adventures of Peregrine Pickle, 1751:"Some falsified printed accounts, artfully cooked up, on purpose to mislead and deceive."Apart from in the expression 'cooking the books' this use of 'cook' has disappeared from the language and the expression, while still being used occasionally, had itself became increasingly uncommon throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The preferred euphemism for the manipulation of financial statements came to be 'creative accounting'. This is first recorded in the 1960s and is attributed to the US comedian Irwin Corey, as in this example from the Middlesboro Daily News, May 1968:'Professor' Irwin Corey claims his CPA [Certified Public Accounts] isn't exactly crooked - but the government's questioning him about his "creative accounting".The numerous corporate fraud cases of the 1990s turned public opinion against the semi-admiring tone of 'creative accounting' and journalists stopped using it. That, and the transformation of bookshops, which now seem to sell more coffee and cakes than they do books, has brought about a revival of the term 'cooking the books', which looks like staying with us for some years to come.

Boxing DayMeaningThe 26th of December, also called St. Stephen's Day. Boxing Day is a public holiday that forms part of the Christmas festivities in most of the countries that were once part of the British Empire. It was originally the first working day after Christmas Day, but is now always celebrated on December 26th, regardless of which day of the week it falls.OriginChristmas boxes were originally literally earthenware boxes. In mediaeval England, these boxes were used by the poor (servants, apprentices etc.) to save money throughout the year. At Christmas, the boxes were broken open and the savings shared to fund Christmas festivities. This meaning of Christmas box dates back to at least the early 17th century. The boxes were known in France as tirelire and are referred to in Randle Cotgrave's A Dictionarie of the French and English tongues, 1611:"Tirelire, a Christmas box; a box having a cleft on the lid, or in the side, for money to enter it; used in France by begging Fryers, and here by Butlers, and Prentices, etc."In a similar tradition, which is almost as old as the above and which is the one that has stayed with us until the present day, Christmas boxes were gifts, usually money, given to tradespeople or others who have rendered some service throughout the year but who aren't normally paid directly by the donor - for example, office cleaners, milkmen etc. So, why is Boxing Day so called? Sporting fixtures, which used regularly to include boxing, have taken place over the holiday season for centuries. The view that Boxing Day was a day for pugilism gets some support via the earliest reference to the name that I can find, which is in The Sporting Magazine, Volume 25, 1805: On boxing-day, Dec. 26, a numerous assemblage of the holiday folk were amused by a hard fought battle, in St. Pancras-fields. This fight was one that afforded plenty of diversion to several pugilists and admirers of the art present. Nevertheless, the link to boxing in that citation is just co-incidence and the origin of the name is the giving of 'Christmas box' gifts to tradespeople, which traditionally took place, not on Christmas Day, but on the first subsequent working day.

Go off at half-cockMeaningSpeak or act prematurely.OriginFlintlock firearms have a 'cock' or striker mechanism, which is held in a raised, sprung position ready to discharge and make a spark to 'fire' the gun. These can be set at half-cock, when the gun is in a safe state, or at full-cock, when it is ready to be fired. A gun would only 'go off at half-cock' by mistake. The term half-cock is as old as flintlock guns and appears in print from the mid 18th century. For example, in John Desaguliers' A course of experimental philosophy 1734?4:"The gun being at Half-Cock, the Spring acts upon the Tumbler with more Advantage."The earliest known citation of the phrase 'going off at half-cock' comes from London and Its Environs Described, 1761:"Some arms taken at Bath in the year 1715, distinguished from all others in the Tower, by having what is called dog locks; that is, a kind of lock with a catch to prevent their going off at half-cock." We now commonly use 'go off at half-cock' or, in America, 'go off half-cocked', to mean 'speak or act impulsively and without proper preparation'. This clearly alludes to the sudden discharge of a firearm. Despite that, the first figurative use of the phrase had a completely different meaning. When the 'half-cocked' imagery was first appropriated it was to mean tipsy, or half-drunk. This was the meaning intended in John Shebbeare's novel Lydia, 1786:"Who should enter unto the company, but young Captain Firebrace, half-cocked... come hither to finish his evening's potation." There doesn't appear to be any particular link between the mechanics of firearms and drunkenness. Several other 'half' phrases were also used in the 18th century to mean 'half-drunk'. 'Half-seas-over' was a nautical term that is listed in the first slang dictionary BE's Dictionary of the Canting Crew, circa 1700, with the meaning 'almost drunk'. Another example is 'half-and-half', which, in addition to being the name of a mixture of equal parts ale and porter, was also listed as a term meaning 'tipsy'. This meaning of 'half-cocked' was taken up with particular enthusiasm in Australia. Clearly, they felt they hadn't enough terms for drunkenness and wanted to expand their repertoire. Fergus Hume's Madame Midas: a story of Australian mining life, 1888, explained the term:"This last drink reduced Mr. Villiers to that mixed state which is known in colonial phrase as half-cocked."By 1888, the rest of the English-speaking world had opted for the current meaning of 'half-cock' and 'half-cocked'. For example, in To-day in Ireland, 1825:"Master Dillon - never let an insult go off half-cock." Across the Atlantic, The Register of Debates in Congress, 1833, recorded the opinions of Dutee Pearce of Rhode Island:"I regret that the gentleman from Maryland has gone off half cocked." See also - lock, stock and barrel.

Parting shotMeaningA final remark, usually cutting or derogatory, made just before departing.OriginA 'parting shot' is now a metaphorical term but it clearly alludes to the shooting of weapons. The first such literal reference that I've come across is in the writings of John McLeod, who was surgeon of His Majesty's Ship Alceste. McLeod includes this comment in A Narrative of a Voyage to The Yellow Sea, 1818:The consort, firing a parting shot, bore up round the north end of the island, and escaped.The figurative use of the phrase comes not much later, in the records of the Religious Society of Friends (The Quakers) - The Friend or, Advocate of Truth, 1828:I think it would be much more becoming..., if you could separate without giving each other a parting shot. If you could but use this short sentence, "we cannot agree and therefore we separate." That derivation of 'parting shot' appears to be very simple and straightforward. Not so fast; enter the Parthians and their 'Parthian shots'. The Partians were an ancient race who lived in north-east Persia. They were renowned archers and horsemen and were known for their practice of confusing the enemy by pretending to flee and firing arrows backwards while retreating - not the easiest thing to do on a galloping horse. The tactic must have been successful as in first century B.C. Parthia stretched from the Euphrates to the Indus rivers, covering most of what is now Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. The Parthians' reputation was well known to English-speaking scholars in the 16th and 17th centuries. For example, Samuel Butler makes a specific reference to their battle tactic in An Heroical Epistle of Hudibras to His Lady, 1678:You wound, like Parthians, while you fly, And kill with a retreating eye.The use of the actual term 'Parthian shot' comes rather later. As with 'parting shot', the literal use comes first. That is found in A Tour in India, the account of a Captain Mundy, who was Aide-de-Camp to Lord Combermere during a shooting trip to India in 1832. With all the bravery of those who now club baby seals to death, Mundy describes his heroic encounter with a tiger:Out rushed a little cub tiger of about three months, and charged me so courageously that my elephant took to her heels. I made a successful Parthian shot with my favourite Joe Manton [shotgun], and slew my determined little pursuer.The metaphorical use of 'Parthian shot' comes soon afterwards, in The Times, April 1842:They have probably enough dealt a Parthian shot to British interests, by setting the Nacional once more upon its legs.Having two almost identical terms in the language which mean the same thing has led to the belief that one derives from the other. That may be the case, but there's no real 'smoking gun' evidence to link the two. 'Parthian shot' is unlikely to have derived from 'parting shot', as the military tactic it alludes to is so ancient. The fact that the earliest known examples of 'parting shot' pre-date those of 'Parthian shot' also tends to suggest that they were coined separately. We can't be sure, but is seems that the similarity between the two expressions is just co-incidence.

Ups-a-daisyMeaningAn exclamation made when encouraging a child to get up after a fall or when lifting a child into the air.OriginIt is difficult to choose which of the numerous variants of the expression to use as the heading of this piece. As with many words that are said to small children, it is more often a spoken term than one that appears in print and this has led to much inconsistency about how it is spelled. In fact, I can't think of a single term that appears in so many different spellings. For example:UpsidaisyUpsa daesyUpsy-daisyOops-a-daisyOopsy-daisyHoops-a-daisyThe form in which it is now most commonly spoken and spelled is 'oops-a-daisy'. The first known printed record of any form of the term is in Clough Robinson's The dialect of Leeds and its neighbourhood, 1862:Upsa daesy! a common ejaculation when a child, in play, is assisted in a spring-leap from the ground.This was preceded by 'up-a-daisy', which has its own variations of spelling - 'up-a-dazy', 'up-a-daisey', etc. Jonathan Swift used this in his collection of letters, which was published in 1711 as The Journal to Stella:Come stand away, let me rise... Is there a good fire? - So - up a-dazy.The earlier dialect term 'upaday', which has the same meaning, appears to be the source. The 'daisy' part is a fanciful extension of 'day', perhaps alluding to the child being on the ground amongst the daisies. Of course, the name daisy itself derives from 'day' - the flower, which closes at night and exposes its yellow centre in sunlight, was thought of as the day's eye. Not content with spawning so many forms, ups-a-daisy also has a role in the coining of the word 'lackadaisical'. This first appears in the language in 1768 and can be traced backwards to 'alack-the-day', which dates to at least Shakespeare's usage of it in Romeo and Juliet, 1592:Shee's dead, deceast, shee's dead: alacke the day!In the next century, this mutated to the more familiar form 'lack-a-day', which is found in The Grounds & Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy and Religion, by John Eachard, 1685:'Lack a day! says one of the accomplish'd, in what a lamentable condition I have seen a mortal Clergyman.In the middle of the next century we find 'lack-a-daisy', in Tobias Smollett's The Adventures of Roderick Random 1748:Good lack-a-daisy! the rogue is fled!This is a form of 'lack-a-day' with the ending taken from 'ups-a-daisy'. From 'lack-a-daisy', it isn't a long step, either in time or language, to 'lackadaisical', which is first recorded in Laurence Sterne's A sentimental journey through France and Italy, 1768:Sitting in my black coat, and in my lack-adaysical manner, counting the throbs of it. 'Ups-a-daisy' is clearly also the direct source of 'whoops-a-daisy'. This has a different meaning and is an exclamation made after a stumble or other mistake. It is usually said by the perpetrator of the error and the saying out loud is a public acknowledgement, somewhat like 'mea culpa'. 'Whoops-a-daisy', and the shortened forms 'whoops' and 'oops', are all American in origin. The expression is first recorded, as 'Whoopsie Daisy!', in the New Yorker, in September 1925. In the 1999 film Notting Hill, Hugh Grant's character falls over, saying 'whoops a daisies'. Julia Roberts' character then says:"No one has said 'whoops a daisies' for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets."Maybe that's true in California, but it's rather surprising that the film's English screenwriter, Richard Curtis, gave her that line in a film set in London. Like many in the UK, I still use the phrase frequently, but, as a large middle-aged man with a small amount of straight brown hair, I don't qualify on any of Roberts' criteria.

Best bib and tuckerMeaningOne's best clothes.OriginThis term originated not in any figurative sense, but literally - both bibs and tuckers were items of women's clothing from the 17th to late 19th centuries. Early bibs were somewhat like modern day bibs, although they weren't specifically used to protect clothes from spilled food as they are now. Tuckers were lace pieces fitted over the bodice - sometimes called 'pinners' or 'modesty pieces'. These were known by the late 17th century and were described by Randle Holme in The Academy of Armory, or a Storehouse of Armory and Blazon, 1688:"A Pinner or Tucker, is a narrow piece of Cloth - which compasseth the top of a Womans Gown about the Neck part."Tuckers, as the name suggests, were originally tucked in. Pinners differed by being pinned rather than tucked. Pinner is clearly the precursor of pinafore - originally pin-a-fore, i.e. pinned on the front. Incidentally, the blazons of the title of Holme's book gave the name to another form of dress - the blazer. Blazons were the heraldic coats of arms or badges of office worn by the king's messenger. Blazer jackets, which became fashionable in the early 20th century as uniforms for supporters of sports teams and as school uniforms, mimicked the heraldic style. 'Best bib and tucker' is an 18th century term, the first known citation of which is from a translation of the Marquis d'Argens' ambitiously entitled work New Memoirs establishing a True Knowledge of Mankind, 1747:"The Country-woman minds nothing on Sundays so much as her best Bib and Tucker."Tuckers continued to be worn until the late 19th century. Charlotte Bronte referred to the practice in Jane Eyre, 1847:"Some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week; the rules limit them to one."'Tuck' is a slang term for food which was coined in English public schools in the 19th century. For example, Thomas Hughes' Tom Brown's School Days, 1857:"The Slogger looks rather sodden, as if he didn't take much exercise and ate too much tuck." This migrated to Australia, where it was modified to tucker. Both this meaning of tucker and the women's bib meaning have connections with food and it is tempting to speculate that they are in some way connected. It seems that they aren't. Tucker in the food sense derives from the earlier term 'a tuck-out' (later also 'tuck-in'), which meant 'a hearty meal'. 'Tuck-out' was synonymous with 'blow-out'. Both terms are listed in John Badcock's Slang: A Dictionary of the Turf, 1823:Blow-out - a good dinner will blow-out a man's tripes like any thing; so will a heavy supper. Either, or any other gormandising meal, is also 'a famous tuck-out'.'Blow-out', which appears to have had quite a crude meaning, is a long way removed from the protective crinoline bibs worn by Jane Austen heroines. Another link that is sometimes made is the possible connection between tucker and tuxedo. The two names sound similar of course and the cummerbund that is usually worn with the formal tuxedo suit is rather like a tucker. There's no foundation to that notion. Tuxedos are named from Tuxedo Park, New York, where they were first worn in 1886.

I haven't got a clueMeaningWithout any knowledge or understanding. OriginThis little phrase, which is often given as 'I don't have a clue', doesn't at first sight appear to be idiomatic at all and hardly deserving of investigation. After all, a clue is an insight or idea that points us towards a solution. To be without a clue is simply to be ignorant. However, a clue (also spelled clew) previously had a different meaning - a globular ball formed from coiling worms or the like or, more specifically, a ball of thread. Clew has been used with that meaning for at least a thousand years and citations of it in Old English date back to 897AD, when no less an author than Aelfred, King of Wessex used it in his West-Saxon translation of Gregory's Pastoral Care. Shakespeare also used the word with the 'thread' meaning, for example, in All's Well that Ends Well, 1601:"If it be so, you have wound a goodly clewe."That seems a long way from crossword clues or Sherlock Holmes' stories. How did we get from a ball of thread to the current meaning of clue? Go back to Greek myth and recall the tale of Theseus and the Minotaur. Theseus entered the labyrinth to kill the half-man, half-bull Minotaur. He did so but was only able to find his way out by retracing his path, marked by the string given to him by Ariadne. So, Theseus 'had a clew' about the safe route out of the maze and was able to escape.Geoffrey Chaucer recorded this story in The Legend of Ariadne, Part VI of The Legend of Good Women, 1385: Therto have I a remedie in my thoght,By a clewe of twyn as he hath gon, The same weye he may returne a-non, ffolwynge alwey the thred as he hath come. So, don't be clueless - all you need is some string.

The devil to payMeaningImpending trouble or other bad consequences following from one's actions. OriginPeople seem to love ascribing nautical origins to phrases. Here's a good case in point. The 'devil' is a seam between the planking of a wooden ship. Admiral William Henry Smyth defined the term in The Sailor's Word-book: An Alphabetical Digest of Nautical Terms, 1865:Devil - The seam which margins the waterways on a ship's hull.'Paying' is the sailor's name for caulking or plugging the seam between planking with rope and tar etc. 'Paying the devil' must have been a commonplace activity for shipbuilders and sailors at sea. This meaning of 'paying' is recorded as early as 1610, in S. Jourdain's Discovery of Barmudas:Some wax we found cast up by the Sea... served the turne to pay the seames of the pinnis Sir George Sommers built, for which hee had neither pitch nor tarre. Many sources give the full expression used by seafarers as "there抯 the devil to pay and only half a bucket of pitch", or "there抯 the devil to pay and no pitch hot". Nautical origin; case closed? Well, no. The phrase doesn't originate from the name of the ship's seam, as is sometimes supposed. It is the name 'devil' in this context which comes from the phrase 'the Devil to pay', rather than the other way about. The other meaning of paying the Devil alludes to Faustian pacts in which hapless individuals pay for their wishes or misdeeds by forfeiting their soul. This allusion, and the everyday usage meaning 'I am in trouble now, I will have to pay for this later', date from the 18th century. For example, Thomas Brown's Letters From the Dead to the Living, 1707:Don't you know damnation pays every man's scores... we knew we should have the Devil to pay one time or other, and now you see like honest men we have pawn'd our Souls for the whole Reckoning.This quotation predates the earliest recorded usage of 'devil' to mean the seam of a ship (Smyth's Sailor's Workbook, 1865) by more than a century. Given the known nautical meaning of 'paying' a seam and the well-established phrase 'the Devil to pay', sailors probably adopted the phrase in reference to the unpleasant task of seam caulking. George Lemon put forward his understanding of how the phrase was coined in English Etymology, 1783. Lemon explains that, when sailors were ready to start caulking seams before the tar was melted, they used the phrase 'here's the Devil to pay and no pitch hot'. As Lemon put it:"Here's the black gentleman come to pitch the vessel's sides and you have not so much as made the pitch kettle hot enough to employ him." Whether we accept Lemon's version or prefer the 'pact with the Devil' derivation, it is clear that the devil in the phrase was originally a reference to Satan, not the seam of a ship. See also: Between the Devil and the deep blue sea.

AcronymsMeaningWords which are formed from the initial letters of other words.OriginWhen looking for the origin of an unexplained word, people sometimes suggest that the word was coined as an acronym of some phrase or other. Occasionally, that notion is correct and there are some commonly used words that we might use without necessarily being aware they are acronyms, for example 'gulag' or 'Hamas'. Words that were coined as acronyms form quite a small part of the language. Nevertheless, supposed acronym derivations are the largest source of folk etymologies - those popular fallacies about the origins of words or phrases. With many of these false derivations the word comes first and then some suitably chirpy phrase is invented to match it. These back-formations have been given the intuitive name 'backronyms'. There are many examples and two of the more common, 'posh' and 'golf' (supposedly 'port out, starboard home' and 'gentlemen only, ladies forbidden' respectively), make it onto the Nonsense Nine, our list of popular fallacies. Other backronym examples are:cop - Constable on patrol news - North, east, west, south Some backronym coinages make little attempt to feign authenticity and are clearly intended to poke fun. Examples of these are, Ford - Fix or repair daily and DOS - Defunct operating system. Deciding whether an acronym's supposed origin is genuine isn't always so easy. The best place to start is the age of the word. If the word is old, then it probably isn't an acronym. The term 'acronym' itself wasn't coined until the mid 20th century. The earliest known citation of it is from American Notes and Queries, February 1943:Words made up of the initial letters or syllables of other words... I have seen... called by the name acronym. Some examples do date from before 1943 but were rare enough beasts in the early 20th century not to have needed a generic name. The field of computing is now the most prolific source of acronyms - 'gif', 'ascii', 'wysiwyg', 'mpeg', not to mention the names of most programming languages, the list seems endless. Before computers, the military held top spot. Almost all of the earliest known acronyms derive from the armed forces. For example (with the date of their earliest use as an acronym that I know of):Anzac - Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (1915)Naafi - Navy, Army, and Air Force Institutes (1927)Gestapo - Geheime Staats-Polizei (1934)Waaf - Women's Auxiliary Air Force (1940) Radar - Radio detection and ranging (1941)So, if someone suggests to you that the name of the 15th century game of golf was coined as an acronym, you might suggest suitable therapy, or possibly a free membership of the Committee Resisting Acronymic Proliferation.

Raining cats and dogsMeaningRaining very heavily.OriginThis is an interesting phrase in that, although there's no definitive origin, there is a likely derivation. Before we get to that, let's get some of the fanciful proposed derivations out of the way. The phrase isn't related to the well-known antipathy between dogs and cats, which is exemplified in the phrase 'fight like cat and dog'. Nor is the phrase in any sense literal, i.e. it doesn't record an incident where cats and dogs fell from the sky. Small creatures, of the size of frogs or fish, do occasionally get carried skywards in freak weather. Impromptu involuntary flight must also happen to dogs or cats from time to time, but there's no record of groups of them being scooped up in that way and causing this phrase to be coined. Not that we need to study English meteorological records for that - it's plainly implausible. One supposed origin is that the phrase derives from mythology. Dogs and wolves were attendants to Odin, the god of storms, and sailors associated them with rain. Witches, who often took the form of their familiars - cats, are supposed to have ridden the wind. Well, some evidence would be nice. There doesn't appear to be any to support this notion.It has also been suggested that cats and dogs were washed from roofs during heavy weather. This is a widely repeated tale. It got a new lease of life with the e-mail message "Life in the 1500s", which began circulating on the Internet in 1999. Here's the relevant part of that:I'll describe their houses a little. You've heard of thatch roofs, well that's all they were. Thick straw, piled high, with no wood underneath. They were the only place for the little animals to get warm. So all the pets; dogs, cats and other small animals, mice, rats, bugs, all lived in the roof. When it rained it became slippery so sometimes the animals would slip and fall off the roof. Thus the saying, "it's raining cats and dogs."This is nonsense of course. It hardly needs debunking but, lest there be any doubt, let's do that anyway. In order to believe this tale we would have to accept that dogs lived in thatched roofs, which, of course, they didn't. Even accepting that bizarre idea, for dogs to have slipped off when it rained they would have needed to be sitting on the outside of the thatch - hardly the place an animal would head for as shelter in a rainstorm.Another suggestion is that 'raining cats and dogs' comes from a version of the French word 'catadoupe', meaning waterfall. Again, no evidence. If the phrase were just 'raining cats', or even if there also existed a French word 'dogadoupe', we might be going somewhere with this one. As there isn't, let's pass this by.The much more probable source of 'raining cats and dogs' is the prosaic fact that, in the filthy streets of 17th/18th century England, heavy rain would occasionally carry along dead animals and other debris. The animals didn't fall from the sky, but the sight of dead cats and dogs floating by in storms could well have caused the coining of this colourful phrase. Jonathan Swift described such an event in his satirical poem 'A Description of a City Shower', first published in the 1710 collection of the Tatler magazine. The poem was a denunciation of contemporary London society and its meaning has been much debated. While the poem is metaphorical and doesn't describe a specific flood, it seems that, in describing water-borne animal corpses, Swift was referring to an occurrence that his readers would have been well familiar with: Now in contiguous Drops the Flood comes down,Threat'ning with Deluge this devoted Town....Sweeping from Butchers Stalls, Dung, Guts, and Blood,Drown'd Puppies, stinking Sprats, all drench'd in Mud,Dead Cats and Turnip-Tops come tumbling down the Flood.We do know that the phrase was in use in a modified form in 1653, when Richard Brome's comedy The City Wit or The Woman Wears the Breeches referred to stormy weather with the line:"It shall raine... Dogs and Polecats". Polecats aren't cats as such but the jump between them in linguistic rather than veterinary terms isn't large and it seems clear that Broome's version was essentially the same phrase. The first appearance of the currently used version is in Jonathan Swift抯 A Complete Collection of Polite and Ingenious Conversation in 1738: "I know Sir John will go, though he was sure it would rain cats and dogs".The fact that Swift had alluded to the streets flowing with dead cats and dogs some years earlier and now used 'rain cats and dogs' explicitly is good evidence that poor sanitation was the source of the phrase as we now use it.

Round RobinMeaningA tournament in which each contestant plays each of the others.OriginIn order to identify the derivation of 'Round Robin', we need first to be clear about what the term means. It is now used to refer to things that operate in a rotational manner, like tournaments where each player plays every other, circular letters etc. Long before those contemporary meanings were known of, the term Round Robin had been used to refer to a variety of things. The earliest use was as a disparaging nickname, along the lines of 'sly dog' or 'dark horse'. This dates back to the 16th century and was cited in a work by Miles Coverdale, in 1546:Certayne fonde talkers... applye to this mooste holye sacramente, names of despitte and reproche, as to call it Jake in the boxe, and round roben, and suche other not onely fond but also blasphemouse names. [fond then meant confounded, or foolish]Other uses were:- A reference to Roundheads, i.e. the supporters of Parliament during the English Civil War, as in Rump, 1662, which was a collection of scurrilous poems and songs. - The name of a high-spirited game. For example, in The Works of Mr. Thomas Brown, 1707 - "The noble and ancient recreation of Robin-Robin, Hey-Jnks, [sic] and Whipping the Snake."- The name of virtually anything that was round in shape. For instance, Angler fish, pancakes and even, in An Epistle to Lieutenant Hamilton, a Scottish dialect poem by Alan Ramsey, 1721, the chubby little garden visitor, the Robin:Now, now I hope we'll ding the Dutch,As fine as a round Robin,Gin greediness to grow soon richInvites not to stock-jobbingThe variety of contexts in which the term has been used seems to argue against it being derived from the roundness of robins. It is more likely that 'Robin' was attached to 'round' just as a pleasant-sounding alliteration.The currently used ' rotational' meaning is independent of all of the earlier uses. This began in the 18th century as the name of a form of petition, in which the complainants signed their names in a circle, so as to disguise who had signed first. This was especially favoured by sailors - not surprisingly, as mutiny was then a hanging offence. The term is recorded in the January 1730 edition of The Weekly Journal:"A Round Robin is a Name given by Seamen, to an Instrument on which they sign their Names round a Circle, to prevent the Ring-leader being discover'd by it, if found."It may be that this derives from the French 'rond rouban', which was a similar form of petition, in which the names were written on a circle of ribbon. That's an attractive and plausible notion, but I can't find any actual documentary evidence to substantiate it. Another idea, again attractive at first sight, is that the term 'ringleader' derives from the person who was first to sign the circle of names on a round robin. That's not likely, as the first use of ringleader is from well before 1730.The most frequent use of 'Round Robin' now is as the name of tournaments with rounds where everyone plays everyone else. This originated in the USA at the end of the 19th century. The earliest citation I have of that is from the Official Lawn Tennis Bulletin, issued in New York in 1895: "The so-called round-robin tournament, where each man plays every other, furnishes the best possible test of tennis skill."

Strait and narrowMeaningA conventional and law-abiding course. Origin'Straight' is a much more frequently used word than 'strait' these days and so the most common question about this phrase concerns the spelling - should it be 'strait and narrow' or 'straight and narrow'? Well, that depends on just how pedantic you want to be. The source of the expression is the Bible, specifically Matthew 7:13/14. The King James' Version gives these verses as: Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.That clearly opts for 'strait' rather than 'straight', as it calls on a now rather archaic meaning of strait, that is, 'a route or channel, so narrow as to make passage difficult'. This is still found in the names of various sea routes, e.g. the Straits of Dover. Such a nautical strait was defined in the 1867 version of Admiral Smyth's Sailor's Word-book as:"A passage connecting one part of a sea with another."Smyth also offered the opinion that strait "is often written in the plural, but without competent reason".The 'confined and restricted' meaning of strait still also lingers on in straitjacket, dire straits, strait-laced and straitened circumstances. All of these are frequently spelled with 'straight' rather than 'strait'. These spellings, although technically incorrect, are now widely accepted and only 'dire straights' comes in for any sustained criticism. The use of 'straight' is quite understandable, certainly in 'straight and narrow'. After all, it means 'direct and reliable', as in the phrase 'as straight as a die', and the imagery of a direct and unwavering route to salvation would have been attractive to Christian believers in the 17th century, when that version of the spelling first appeared. It was included in an 1827 publication of A Journal of George Fox, Volume 1, which claims to be a facsimile reprint of the 1694 original journal. The earliest definitive documentation that I can find comes from a few years later, in The Critical Works of Monsieur Rapin, 1706:"The soul of the common people seems too straight and narrow to be wrought upon by any Part of Eloquence."This version of the phrase is old enough and close enough in date to the earliest example of 'strait and narrow' that I can find in print as to match it in status. That example is in A Vindication of the Government in Scotland: During the Reign of King Charles II, 1712:"Strait and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life."'Straight and narrow' is now the more common spelling and you will be in good company if you opt to use it, even though 'strait and narrow' might be a better choice if you want to get high marks in that English language test.

Through thick and thinMeaningThrough all forms of obstacle that are put in one's way. Origin'Through thick and thin' is one of the English language's older expressions and one that has maintained its figurative meaning over many centuries. It is venerable enough to date from the times when England was still a predominantly wooded country, with few roads and where animals grazed on what was known as wood pasture, i.e. mixed woodland and grass. The phrase originated as 'through thicket and thin wood', which was a straightforward literal description of any determined progress through the 'thick' English countryside. The earliest citation I can find that uses our contemporary wording is in Richard Baxter's religious text A Saint Or a Brute: The Certain Necessity and Excellency of Holiness, 1662:"Men do fancy a necessity [of holiness] where there is none, yet that will carry them through thick and thin."The phrase had been in use in Old and Middle English, in the literal 'thicket or thin wood' sense, for some centuries before that. The earliest known usage is in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Reeve's Tale:And whan the hors was laus, he gynneth gonToward the fen, ther wilde mares renne,And forth with "wehee," thurgh thikke and thurgh thenne. [And when the horse was loose, he begins to goToward the fen, where wild mares runAnd forth with "wehee," through thick and through thin]

Guinea-pigMeaningA person or animal who is used as the subject of an experiment.OriginIt isn't at all clear why these cute family pets came to be given their name. They are cavies, not pigs, and they don't originate from Guinea. Both 'guinea' and 'pig' seem to stem from simple, but mistaken, associations. The name 'guinea pig' dates from the 17th century and the first record of it is in Henry Power's Experimental Philosophy, 1664:"You may see them... like so many Ginny-Pigs, munching and chewing the cud."The 'guinea' part of the name is perplexing. It was certainly a reference to a place rather than to the idea that the animals cost a guinea to buy, as is sometimes wrongly suggested. Guinea is in fact in West Africa but the little rodents, properly called Cavia Cobaya, are from the Andean region of South America. It could be that the name derives from the 'Guineamen', which were sailing ships that followed a route from the UK to Africa and then on to the Americas, plying the slave trade. It could also be that the distinction between East Africa and South America wasn't as clear as it is now. 'Guinea' may have just been a synonym for 'somewhere a long way across the sea'. 'Pig' is a little easier to understand. Cavies do at least look somewhat like tiny pigs and that was in the mind of the academics who first gave them a Latin name - Cavia porcellus, porcellus meaning 'little pig'. This is in line with the habit at the time of naming any small and vaguely porcine creatures as 'pigs'. George Gascoigne's translation of Noble Arte Venerie, 1575 does that for baby badgers:"There are Foxes and theyr Cubbes, and Badgerdes and theyr Pigges."The same loose associations were no doubt at work when the animal was called the Spanish Coney in a 1710 edition of The British Apollo: Containing Two Thousand Answers to Curious Questions in Arts and Sciences:"A Guinea Pig... in Johnston's Natural History goes by the Name of a Spanish Coney."Coney was the old name for rabbit so, instead of a pig from Guinea we have a rabbit from Spain.The first use of the term 'guinea pig' to describe a person didn't have the current 'subject of an experiment' meaning, but was a name for inexperienced midshipmen on the sailing ships mentioned above, as recorded in The Adventures of a Kidnapped Orphan, 1747:"He sent his nephew, at the age of fourteen, on a voyage as a Guinea-pig."It wasn't until the 20th century that the expression was given its current meaning. This was first alluded to by George Bernard Shaw, in Quintessence of Ibsenism Now Completed, 1913:"The... folly which sees in the child nothing more than the vivisector sees in a guinea pig: something to experiment on with a view to rearranging the world." Shaw, who was a noted vegetarian and what would now be called an animal liberationist, was referring to the practice of using guinea pigs in scientific experiments. This had been going for some time by 1913. The celebrated French chemist Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in an experiment on respiration in 1780. Why guinea pigs were chosen as subjects of experimentation isn't entirely clear. They may not have cost the huge price of a guinea but, being imported from 'Guinea', they were more expensive than mice and rats, which have now largely, if doubtless reluctantly, taken their place.

Chaise loungeMeaningA form of sofa with a backrest at one end only. Origin'Chaise lounge' appears to be a very early example of an eggcorn, dating from long before eggcorns were given a name. [Note: eggcorns are words or phrases which have been coined mistakenly, often due to an incorrect guess as to how a word is spelled, but one which makes some kind of sense. For example, Old-Timer's Disease for Alzheimer's Disease and daring-do for derring-do.] 'Chaise lounge', also sometimes spelled 'chase lounge', began life as such a linguistic mistake and has survived because it does make intuitive sense. The piece of furniture in question is properly called a 'chaise longue'. The name is of French origin, of course, and has been known there since the 18th century, translating into English simply as 'long chair' - which is just what it is. The understandability of the misspelling of 'longue' as 'lounge' is that lounging is what one does on these sofas and the supposed translation of 'lounging chair' makes perfect sense. The spelling and pronunciation as 'chaise lounge' is largely limited to America. It is so well-established there that it is far too late to turn back the clock - only the most foolhardy of visitors to the USA would attempt to flag it as a mistake. The confusion for those outside America is added to by the fact that those items of garden or poolside furniture which are known in most other English-speaking countries as a 'sun-loungers', are also often called 'chaise lounges' in the USA. Those English-speakers from the Mother Country who look down on this as a typical mangling of the language by those uncultured Yanks might be dismayed to find that the earliest known citation of the 'chaise lounge' spelling comes from no less a bastion of 'proper' English than The Times newspaper. The January 16th 1807 edition included an advert for An Assemblage of truly elegant furniture, fitted up in the most modern style, and this includes the offer of "sofas, chaise lounge, loo tables" etc. The earliest citation that I can find from America, and which appears to refer to a 'sun-lounger', is in the 4th January 1875 edition of The Newport Daily News: "A real rattan chaise lounge, such as is made at Singapore."

Point-blankMeaningClose enough to go directly to a target.OriginIn the Late Middle Ages, when 'point-blank' was coined, archery and artillery targets were usually white. 'Blank' derives from the French 'blanc', which of course means white. 'Point' is a little more ambiguous. What was first meant by 'point-blank range' was rather more precise than our current meaning. Then, as now, it meant 'too close to miss', but the specific meaning was 'within the distance that a missile travels in a direct line, with no perceptible drop due to gravity'. The 'point' in the term may have referred to the point of the arrow that was about to be fired - if the point coincided with the target in the archer's eyeline then the target would be hit, so long as it was within 'point-blank range'. Another interpretation is that 'point' was a verb and that 'point-blank' just meant 'pointing at the (blanc) target'. The expression betrays its ye-olde origins by appearing first in print in the form of 'poynt blancke'. An example of that comes from the English mathematician Thomas Digges' Arithmetical Military Treatise, 1579, asking the kind of question that might have turned up in a Tudor maths lesson (no wonder they crept like snails, unwilling to school):If a Falcon that carrieth poynt blancke 150 pase, at vtmost randon randge 1300 pases, I demaunde howe farre a Culuering at his vtmost randon will reach, that at poynt blancke, or leuell, rangeth 250 pase.Note: Falcons and culverins were cannons, small and large respectively. Into the 17th century and the 'direct level flight' meaning was alluded to by no less an author than Sir Walter Raleigh, in The History of the World, 1614:Training his Archers to shoot compasse, who had bin accustomed to the point blanke. Note: Compass meant 'curved', as in the flight of an arrow over a long distance.The figurative 'direct and blunt' meaning that we now often use is found in phrases like 'asked/denied/refused pointblank'. This also came into use around the turn of the 17th century and was listed in John Florio's English/Italian dictionary A worlde of wordes, 1598, in which he equates 'forthright' with 'point blanke'.

Silver bulletMeaningA direct and effortless solution to a problem. OriginWe now use the term 'silver bullet' to refer to an action which cuts through complexity and provides an immediate solution to a problem. The allusion is to a miraculous fix, otherwise portrayed as 'waving a magic wand'. This figurative use derives from the use of actual silver bullets and the widespread folk belief that they were the only way of killing werewolves or other supernatural beings. The most famous user of silver bullets was of course the Lone Ranger. This cowboy series ran from 1933 on radio and later as a highly popular television show. Silver bullets fitted well with the masked hero's miraculous persona. He typically arrived from nowhere, overcame evil and departed, leaving behind only a silver bullet and echoes of 'who was that masked man?'.The belief in the magical power of silver, especially of weapons made from silver, is very ancient. Book XVI of Horace's Odes has it that the Delphic Oracle advised Philip of Macedonia to 'fight with silver spears'. References to the use of silver bullets date from the late 17th century. An early 19th century citation which specifically mentions the belief in their use as the only way to kill evil supernatural beings is found in Sir Walter Scott's Tales of My Landlord, 1816:Conspicuous by his black horse and white feather ... the object of aim to everyone, he seemed as if he were impassive to their shots. The superstitious fanatics looked upon him as a man gifted by the Evil Spirit with supernatural means of defence. Many a whig that day loaded his musket with a dollar cut into slugs, in order that a silver bullet (such was their belief) might bring down the persecutor of the holy kirk, on whom lead had no power.There are numerous examples in 19th century fiction of the efficacy of silver bullets against werewolves, witches, the Devil and all manner of creatures, which were generically called 'uncanny bodies'.Into the 20th century and the term was adopted in other contexts as meaning a solution to a problem. War bonds with that name were issued in 1914. In 1916, The Times advised the population of the UK to:"Invest the savings in buying 'Silver Bullets' in the form most suitable and convenient - Exchequer bonds, or through the Post Office Savings Bank."Silver Bullet cocktails, a solution in a literal sense, were devised a little later. Harry Craddock's Savoy Cocktail Book, 1930, lists the ingredients:Silver bullet cocktail. {half} Gin. {quarter} Lemon Juice. {quarter} Kummel. Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.The expression 'magic bullet' also came into being at around this time. This had a similar meaning to 'silver bullet' but related specifically to highly targeted medical treatments. It was coined by the German scientist Paul Ehrlich in a speech in 1906, using the German word Zauberkugel. This was translated as 'magic bullet' when Ehrlich's work was reported in Science, in August 1924:"Ehrlich aptly compared them [natural antibodies] to magic bullets, constrained by a charm to fly straight to their specific objective, and to turn aside from anything else in their path."Oddly, the figurative use of 'silver bullet' that is now commonplace wasn't adopted into general use until well after all of the above, probably in response to the activities of 'that masked man'. The US newspaper The Bedford Gazette included this piece in a September 1951 issue:"There are those who warn against viewing the atom as a magic weapon... I agree. This is not a silver bullet which can deliver itself or otherwise work military miracles."

Blown to smithereensMeaningDisintegrated into small fragments, by a sudden impact or explosion. OriginSmithereens is an Irish word. It derives from, or is possibly the source of, the modern Irish 'smidir韓', which means 'small fragments'. There is a town near Baltimore, close to the south-west coast of Ireland, called Skibbereen. The name means 'little boat harbour' and it is tempting to imagine sailing ships arriving there from the wild Atlantic by being 'blown to Skibbereen'. The more recent 'Troubles' also bring up images of property/people being dynamited and 'blown to Skibbereen' from all over Ireland. There's no record of any such phrase however, and the similarity between the words Skibbereen and smithereens seems to be no more than co-incidence. Another enticing notion as to the source of smithereens is that it refers to the shards of metal formed when iron is forged and hammered in a smithy. Again, there's nothing but wishful thinking to support that idea. The actual origin is more prosaic. 'Smiodar' means fragments in Irish. 'Een' is a commonplace diminutive ending, as in colleen (girl), i.e. Caile (country woman) + een. Similarly, smiodar + een lead us to smithereen. As with many words that are inherited from other languages, it took some time for the English spelling to become stable. Both 'smiddereens' and 'shivereens' are recorded in the mid 19th century. The notion of things being 'broken/smashed/blown to smithereens' dates from at least the turn of the 19th century. Francis Plowden, in The History of Ireland, 1801, records a threat made against a Mr. Pounden by a group of Orangemen: "If you don't be off directly, by the ghost of William, our deliverer, and by the orange we wear, we will break your carriage in smithereens, and hough your cattle and burn your house."['Hough' is a variant of 'hock' - to disable by cutting the tendons]Smithereens is one of those unusual nouns that, like suds and secateurs, never venture out by themselves - the word is always plural.

Bale out/bail outMeaningVarious meanings, including 'making an emergency parachute escape from an aeroplane' and 'ladling water from a boat'. OriginThis is an unusual phrase (or is that pair of phrases?) in that it isn't the origin or the meaning that is the source of debate, but the spelling. Is it 'bale out' or bail out', and should there be different spellings for the different meanings of the phrase? Those meanings would be a good place to start:- Make an emergency exit from an aeroplane, using a parachute.- Ladle water from a boat.- Liberate from prison, into the security of a guarantor.- Jump from a surfboard/skateboard/bicycle etc., in order to avoid getting injured.- Step away from a pitch in baseball. You may be clear in your own mind as to the correct spelling for each of these. Whichever you opt for you will have no difficulty in finding supporting examples in print. There are many examples of both 'bail out' and 'bale out' for all of the above meanings. There is a 'correct' spelling for each however, based on whether the expression in question derives from 'bale' or 'bail' and, more significantly, where you live. In the USA, 'bail' is almost always used for all variants. Let's take the meanings for which there is a degree of agreement about the spelling. The ladling of water from a boat is properly written as 'bailing' or 'bailing out'. This derives from 'baile', which is an early name for a bucket or pail. It is tempting to imagine that a bail is some sort of cross between a bucket and a pail, but that's just fancy. This usage has been known since the 17th century. For example, Samuel Purchas's Pilgrimage, 1613:They bailed and pumped two thousand tuns [another name for bucket] and yet were ten foot deepe. Liberating from prison, often on the payment of a surety, is also unambiguously 'bailing out'. This derives from the French 'baillier' - to deliver on trust. This usage dates back to the 14th century in French and appears in Shakespeare in Titus Andronicus, 1588:Thou shalt not baile them, see thou follow me.The last two meanings above, which both utilize the sense of 'bail' as withdrawing from something, are clearly of fairly recent American derivation and it is reasonable to defer to the US 'bail' spelling there. The earliest example I can find of such is in Ted Masters' Surfing Made Easy, 1962:Bailing out, getting off and away from the surfboard on purpose. What is essentially the same meaning of 'bailing' was adopted as Valley Speak, as demonstrated in Mimi Pond's Valley Girl's Guide to Life, 1982:When you skip school.., it's cool to go, 'like, I bailed, man.' Or when you leave a party, you go, 'Let's bail.'The only meaning of 'bail/bale out' for which the spelling is widely disputed is the emergency exiting of aeroplanes. This depends on whether the allusion being made is to aircrew being bundled out of a stricken aeroplane like a bale of hay, or being tipped out as in the bailing out of a boat. An alternative allusion for the 'bail' spelling would be the 'bailing out of', i.e. the removing from, jail. The US 'bail out' shows that they rejected the bale of hay imagery. It isn't merely that the US have opted to spell hay-bale as hay-bail - they are quite happy to 'tote that barge and lift that bale'. The earliest reference I can find to the naming of the jump from an aircraft is from the USA, in a September 1925 edition of The Oakland Tribune:The pilot who has to 慴ail out?hurriedly from a crippled or burning plane.In other parts of the English-speaking world, should you decide to record your heroic jump from an aircraft, you'd be advised to write it as 'bale out'. The first record of this from a non-US source is Fred Tredrey's flying school diary, Pilot's Summer, 1939:If you bale out and land in water... a smart rap will release the whole lot and you can swim free.

To bandy wordsMeaningTo argue persistently.OriginTo 'bandy' is to 'exchange', to 'toss to and fro'. This is the source of the name of the game bandy - a ferocious ball game similar to ice hockey. The word was in use in English by the 16th century and had counterparts in both French (bander) and Spanish (bandear), although which of these came first is uncertain. The sport originally associated with bandying wasn't bandy itself, but tennis. Raphael Holinshed's The firste volume of the chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande, 1577, includes:"Kingdoms... be no balles for me to bandie."He was probably referring there to tennis 'balles' and tennis was mentioned explicitly in Randle Cotgrave's A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues, 1611. Cotgrave translated the French verb 'bander' as the English 'bandie' and gave an example of its use as "to bandie at Tennis". The 16th century was well before the development of lawn tennis and the game being referred to was what we now call real tennis (or in some countries court tennis) - which may be a corruption of royal tennis. This was an indoor game in which the walls form part of the court. The best known court, which is still in use, was built at Hampton Court Palace by Henry VIII in 1530.A 'bandy' was a particular sort of tennis stroke. Players would shout 'A Bandy, Sir', when returning the ball. A 'bandy' must have been different in some way from other strokes - players would presumably have soon got tired of shouting that warning every time the ball was played. It is known that a 'check' was a return in which the ball didn't strike the walls, i.e. the only form of stroke allowed in modern-day tennis. It is possible that a 'bandy' was a 'check' that was returned - that's speculation though, we just don't know. Whatever the precise meaning in real tennis, the word bandy was taken up to mean 'to and fro' and soon became used in other expressions. For example, Shakespeare used it in King Lear, 1605:"Do you bandy lookes with me, you Rascall?"Samuel Johnson used it in 1767, as reported by Boswell, 1831:"It was not for me to bandy civilities with my sovereign."There are various records of people 'bandying taunts' and 'bandying arguments' during the 17th and 18th centuries. The first example that I can find of 'bandy words with' is in The Fair Maid of the Inn, by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, 1750, in which a character refuses to be taunted into an argument concerning a promise of marriage:"I'll not bandy Words, but thus dissolve the contract."

Donkey's yearsMeaningA very long time. OriginA query at the Phrases and Sayings Discussion Forum asked if the British slang term for 'a very long time' was donkey's years or donkey's ears. My first thoughts were, "donkey's years of course - what would ears have to do with it?". It turns out that I was being rather hasty. Donkey's years is now the more commonly used slang term when meaning 'a long time', but donkey's ears, although used little in recent years, has been a jokey alternative for some time - certainly from the early 20th century, viz. E. V. Lucas' Vermilion Box, 1916:"Now for my first bath for what the men call 'Donkey's ears', meaning years and years."This slightly pre-dates the earliest printed version that I can find of donkey's years, in the US newspaper The Bridgeport Telegram, 1923:"With a heavy make-up, you'll be the cutest vamp I've seen in donkey's years."It is quite likely that donkey's ears was the earlier form and that it originated as rhyming slang, in an allusion to the length of the animal's ears. Donkey's ears/years is often shortened just to donkeys. That is characteristic of rhyming slang, as in syrup (of figs) - wig or plates (of meat) - feet. Donkey's ears works as rhyming slang whereas donkey's years doesn't. In rhyming slang the last word of a short phrase is rhymed with the word that gives the slang meaning. For example, trouble and strife - wife, apples and pears - stairs, etc. It makes little sense for the phrase to have originated in slang form as donkey's years, as that would rhyme 'years' with 'years'. The migration from donkey's ears to donkey's years was no doubt aided by the belief that donkeys live a long time. There's some truth in that. Lively Laddie, a donkey who had lived up to his name for many years while plying his trade on Blackpool Pleasure Beach was, at age 62, a contender for the 'oldest living donkey' title.

Let the cat out of the bagMeaningDisclose a secret.OriginThere are two commonly heard suggested origins of this phrase. One relates to the fraud of substituting a cat for a piglet at markets. If you let the cat out of the bag you disclosed the trick - and avoided buying a pig in a poke (bag). This form of trickery is long alluded to in the language and 'pigs in a poke' are recorded as early as 1530.The other theory is that the 'cat' referred to is the cat o' nine tails, which was used to flog ill-disciplined sailors. Again, this has sufficient historical record to be at least possible. The cat o' nine tails was widely used and was referred to in print many years prior to the first use of 'let the cat out of the bag'. The 'nine tails' part of the name derives from the three strands of cord that the rope lashes were made from. Each of the cords were in turn made from three strands of string. When unbraided a piece of rope separated into nine strings. The 'cat' part no doubt alluded to the scratches that the knotted ends of the lash made on the victim's back, like those from a cat's claws. Of the two explanations, the 'pig in a poke' derivation is the more plausible, although I can find no direct documentary evidence to link 'letting the cat out of the bag' to the selling of livestock. The cat o' nine tails story is dubious at best. It is reported that the lashes were sometimes stored in bags, but the suggested nautical punishment origin fails at the critical point, in that it doesn't match the 'disclose a secret' meaning of the phrase. The first known use of the phrase in print that I have found is in a 1760 edition of The London Magazine:"We could have wished that the author... had not let the cat out of the bag."There are several other literary references to the phrase in the 1760s and 1770s, most of which place it in quotations marks - a sure sign of it being not commonly understood and consequently, newly coined. Cats feature very often in English proverbs:A cat may look at a king - 1546All cats are grey in the dark - 1596Curiosity killed the cat - 1921There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream - 1855 When the cat is away, the mice will play - 1607This routine appearance of cats in the language is no doubt a consequence of them being widely kept as mousers and pets in domestic houses. As to 'who let the cats out?', we can't be certain; but it probably wasn't a sailor.

Die-hard Meaning A person who holds stubbornly to a minority view, in defiance of the circumstances.OriginThe title of the 1988 film Die Hard was chosen to signify both the 'hardness' of the lead character and the difficulty that he and the bad guys had in killing each other. In choosing not to hyphenate 'die-hard', which is the currently accepted spelling, they reverted to the original meaning of the term - to 'die hard' was to die reluctantly, resisting to the end. This meaning of the term was recorded in 1703, in Psychologia: or, an Account of the Nature of the Rational Soul. The text argues the pros and cons of a condemned man's approach to death:Against this Reason he [William Coward] urges the case of those that die hard, as they call it, at Tyburn who will therefore, according to him, out-brave the Terrors of the Lord. Tyburn, near what is now Marble Arch, in London, was the principal location for public hangings in England until 1785. The 'drop' method of hanging wasn't then in use and the process was sometimes a prolonged affair. There are records showing that some of those who were about to be hanged opted to take the opposite course to the 'die hards' and paid people to hang onto their legs so that they died quickly. There's no evidence however for the commonly repeated notion that this is the derivation of the phrase 'pulling one's leg'. The wider use of the term came into being in the following century. At the Battle of Albuhera in the Peninsula War in 1811, William Inglis, the commander of the British 57th Regiment of Foot, ordered all ranks "Die hard the 57th, die hard!", i.e. to fight until the last. The regiment later became known as the Die-hards. In the early 20th century, 'die-hard' was more usually used to describe a member of the political faction who were prepared to 'die in the last ditch' in their resistance to the Home Rule Bill of 1912. In 1922, the meaning took a step away from actual deaths, toward our present-day figurative meaning, when the members of the Conservative Party who followed the leadership of the Marquess of Salisbury named themselves 'The Die-hards'.Like 'zigzag', 'meanwhile', and countless other terms which are coined as two words, later to become hyphenated and later still to merge into a single word, the 'diehard' spelling will probably come to be preferred before long.

Ne'er cast a clout till May be outWith most phrases and sayings the meaning is well understood but the origin is uncertain. With this one the main interest is the doubt about the meaning. So, this time, we'll have the origin first. Origin'Ne'er cast a clout till May be out' is an English proverb. The earliest citation is this version of the rhyme from Dr. Thomas Fuller, Gnomologia, 1732, although it probably existed in word-of-mouth form well before that: "Leave not off a Clout Till May be out.MeaningLet's look first at the 'cast a clout' part. The word 'clout', although archaic, is straightforward. Since at least the early 15th century 'clout' has been used variously to mean 'a blow to the head', 'a clod of earth or (clotted) cream' or 'a fragment of cloth, or clothing'. It is the last of these that is meant in 'cast a clout'. This was spelled variously spelled as clowt, clowte, cloot, clute. Here's an early example, from the Early English Miscellanies in Prose and Verse, circa 1485:"He had not left an holle clowt, Wherwith to hyde hys body abowte."So, 'ne'er cast a clout...' simply means 'never discard your [warm winter] clothing...'. The 'till May be out' part is where the doubt lies. On the face of it this means 'until the month of May is ended'. There is another interpretation. In England, in May, you can't miss the Hawthorn. It is an extremely common tree in the English countryside, especially in hedges. Hawthorns are virtually synonymous with hedges. As many as 200,000 miles of hawthorn hedge were planted in the Parliamentary Enclosure period, between 1750 and 1850. The name 'Haw' derives from 'hage', the Old English for 'hedge'. The tree gives its beautiful display of flowers in late April/early May. It is known as the May Tree and the blossom itself is called May. Using that allusion, 'till May is out' could mean, 'until the hawthorn is out [in bloom]'. Other rhymes in which May is ambiguous are:- April showers bring forth May flowers. - Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate:Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer's lease hath all too short a date. (Shakespeare's Sonnet 18) The Hawthorn has long been a potent symbol of rebirth and appears, as May, in other old rhymes. For example, 'Here we go gathering nuts in May'. That is probably a corruption of 'here we go gathering knots of May [blossom]'. After all, there are no nuts to collect in England until Autumn - certainly not in May. Putting the case for the month, as opposed to the flower...A French proverb - 'En avril, ne te d閏ouvre pas d'un fil; en mai, fais ce qui te pla顃'. This translates as 'In April, do not shed a single thread; in May, do as you please', which has much the same meaning as 'ne'er cast a clout...'.Captain John Stevens's work, 'A New Spanish and English Dictionary', published in London in 1706, translates a Spanish proverb, as "Do not leave off your Coat till May be past". Those rhymes may well have originated in England and migrated across the Channel. It is difficult to understand why the Spanish would coin such a proverb, which would seem a little cautious for that part of the world - the average temperature in Seville in May is 20癈. There is a homegrown version that supports the 'month' theory - a fuller version of the rhyme, which goes:"Button to chin, till May be in,Cast not a clout till May be out"The first line appears to have been added later and can't be found earlier than the 20th century. It clearly refers to the month though, as May blossom can come out, but can hardly be expected to go back in again, which indicates that whoever coined this additional line thought that way.There's an explicit mention of the month in the version of the rhyme from F. K. Robertson's Whitby Gazette, 1855:The wind at North and EastWas never good for man nor beastSo never think to cast a cloutUntil the month of May be outWise words for the North Sea-facing Whitby, which can't match Seville and can be icy cold even in mid-summer.All in all, although the May blossom interpretation seems appealing, the 'May' in this proverb is the month of May. It's quite timely that, here in Yorkshire at the end of May, it's turned sunny and warm - having been cold and wet until now. I'm just about ready to take my coat off and head into flaming June.

High-flyerMeaningHigh-flyers, sometimes spelled high-fliers, are people who have achieved notable success, especially those who have become successful more quickly than is normal. The term is also used to describe speculative stock that has reached a high price in a short time. OriginWe might expect this term to have originated in the world of aviation. In a way that's correct. The phrase does in fact predate the invention of planes/balloons by some hundreds of years, but there is an avian connection - if we recall that the word aviation derives from the Latin name for birds - avis. The first known citation of it in print is in Richard Harvey's diatribe Plaine Perceuall the peace-maker of England, 1590:"Men haue great desire to be compted [regarded as] high fliers and deepe swimmers."When looking for the origin of the term we need to take account of its change in meaning over time. When coined in the 16th century it wasn't used admiringly to refer to someone who had achieved success, but critically about someone who unwisely aspired to achievements beyond their talents. We still retain a version of the phrase with that meaning - high-flown, which we reserve for critical judgments of people who are extravagantly ambitious and bombastic. These are of course exactly the character faults that were ascribed to Icarus, the figure of Greek mythology who ignored his father's warnings not to use his homemade wax and feather wings to fly too close to the Sun, resulting in the inevitable crash to Earth. It is clear that, until the late 17th century at least, high-flyers were directly equated with Icarus. For example, William Chilcot's Practical treatise concerning evil thoughts, 1698:"These highflyers, when they are in their altitudes, suddenly their waxen wings melt, and down they fall headlong."

Toodle-ooMeaningA colloquial version of 'goodbye', now rather archaic. OriginThe British term 'toodle-oo' is a fellow-traveller of various terms associated with walking or departing in a carefree manner - toddle, tootle and their extended forms toddle-off and tootle-pip. Let's also not forget tootle-oo, which is a commonly heard alternative form of toodle-oo, and also its Irish variant tooraloo. Tootle is a variant of toddle, both meaning 'walk in a leisurely manner'. Toddle, which is really the base word which leads eventually to toodle-oo, is moderately old and makes an appearance in print in Allan Ramsay's The tea-table miscellany, or a collection of Scots songs, 1724:"Could na my love come todlen hame." [toddling home] The word is still with us in the term 'toddle off' which, although somewhat archaic in sound, is still commonplace in the UK at least. This was in use by the early 19th century and appears in The Dublin University Magazine, 1838:"Show this gentleman to his bedchamber, Klaus... and I'll toddle off to my library," said the Nabob.'Tootle', which also often comes complete with its 'off', has been used to mean 'walk aimlessly' since at least the early 1900s, for example, this piece from the English literary journal The Cornhill Magazine, July 1902:"I tootled down to Cooney's a half-hour before time."'Toodle-oo' sounds the kind of language that we might expect P.G. Wodehouse to indulge in, in his Jeeves and Wooster stories. Wodehouse doesn't disappoint and although he didn't originate the phrase his use of it in an early Jeeves story - Jeeves and the Hard-Boiled Egg, 1919, makes a clear link between toddling and toodling: "Ripping! I'll be toddling up, then. Toodle-oo, Bertie, old man. See you later.""Pip-pip, Bicky, dear boy."He trotted off...The first known record of toodle-oo came just a few years earlier, in a 1907 edition of Punch magazine, which was surely essential reading for the young Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, who was a contributing author to Punch at that date, and so may have written this himself:"Toodle-oo, old sport." Mr. Punch turned round at the amazing words and gazed at his companion.The mixing up of all of these terms may also have been influenced by 'toot-toot' and 'pip-pip', which were used in the early 1900s to denote the sounds of early car horns. This has lead to tootle-pip and toodle-pip, which might be imagined to be from the same period, but which are in fact late 20th century inventions in the Jeeves style. Wodehouse again had an indirect hand in this, as is shown by this piece from his 1920 novel Damsel in Distress:"Well, it's worth trying," said Reggie. "I'll give it a whirl. Toodleoo!" "Good-bye." "Pip-pip!" Reggie withdrew. Tootle-oo is first known from a date that is near enough to that of toodle-oo as to make it difficult to be certain which came first. This variant is recorded in the Letters of T. E. Lawrence (of Arabia), in 1908. The other famous Lawrence, D.H. Lawrence, is coincidentally the first known user of the Irish form tooraloo, also recorded in a letter, this time from 1921, and published in 1968 in Phoenix II:"So long! See you soon! Too-ra-loo!"Before closing, I ought to mention another commonly repeated theory on the origin of 'toodle-oo' - that tootle-oo, and by extension toodle-oo and tooraloo, derived as a slang version of the French ?tout ?l'heure, meaning "I'll see you soon". There's no evidence at all to support this theory, which relies entirely on the co-incidence of sound. There is also some circumstantial evidence against a French origin. Whilst the English and French nobility were closely enough mingled in the Middle Ages for the English then to have taken on many French terms verbatim, by the turn of the 20th century France had long become an unpopular rival. Very few French idioms were granted the status of a popular English slang version in the early 1900s. Just off the top, I can't think of any. It is difficult to imagine a French term being adopted as slang by the hostile and predominantly non-French speaking English populace in 1907.Finally, I suppose we ought also to deal with another derivation theory from the bottom of the pile, so to speak. This is that the word loo derives from toodle-oo, as 'too the loo'. Let's not waste bandwidth further on that one and just say, "it doesn't".

Think outside the boxMeaningThink creatively, unimpeded by orthodox or conventional constraints.Origin'Think outside the box' originated in the USA in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Various authors from the world of management consultancy claim to have introduced it. The earliest citation that I have found comes from the weekly magazine of the US aviation industry - Aviation Week & Space Technology, July 1975:"We must step back and see if the solutions to our problems lie outside the box."The 'box', with its implication of rigidity and squareness, symbolises constrained and unimaginative thinking. This is in contrast to the open and unrestricted 'out of the box' or 'blue-sky' thinking. This latter phrase dates from a little earlier, for example, this piece from the Iowa newspaper the Oelwein Daily Register, April 1945:"Real thinking. Speculation. Pushing out in the blue. Finding out [the facts] was what put me onto the theory of blue-sky thinking."The encouragement to look for solutions from outside our usual thinking patterns was championed in the UK by Edward De Bono, the British psychologist and inventor, who coined the term Lateral Thinking in 1967 and went on to develop it as a method of structured creativity.So, what's this box? It turns out that, rather than being metaphorical, the reference was to a specific box - in the form of a two-dimensional square. Sam Loyd's Cyclopedia of 5000 Puzzles, Tricks, and Conundrums (With Answers), 1914, included a puzzle, known as the 'Nine Dots Puzzle', which was posed like this: "Draw a continuous line through the center of all the eggs so as to mark them off in the fewest number of strokes."Loyd was a little sloppy with the puzzle's rules and ought to have added that the lines must be straight, although he did supply an illustration that makes the meaning clear. The 60/70s management gurus who exhorted trainees to 'think outside the box' made their point by resurrecting the old 'Nine Dots Puzzle' as a test. Those of you who are familiar with the puzzle's solution will see why. If you haven't yet solved it for yourself, just click on the nine-dot image below. (Or, if you have a text-based mail reader, use a web browser to go to http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/think-outside-the-box-solution.html  )

With bells onMeaningEager; ready to participate.OriginThis phrase is frequently used in reply to a party invitation and the common format in that case is to indicate one's enthusiasm with 'I'll be there with bells on!'. The phrase originated in the late 19th/early 20th centuries and most of the early citations of it suggest a US origin. The first record of it that I have found in print, which I doubt is the earliest usage, is in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and the Damned, 1922: "All-ll-ll righty. I'll be there with bells!"The phrase is paralleled in the UK by 'with knobs on', which means, 'with additional ornament'. This is recorded from the 1930s onward, as in the English novelist Margaret Kennedy's The Fool of the Family, 1930:"I'm waiting for the Marchese Ferdinando Emanuele Maria Bonaventura Donzati." "With knobs on," agreed Gemma airily. "Who's he?"The ornamentation is sometimes added to, using the intensified form 'with brass knobs on'. Eric Partridge, in A Dictionary of Catch Phrases, 1977, states that 'with brass fittings' was also known in the USA by 1930, but unfortunately omits any documentary evidence and, as yet, I've been unable to verify that assertion. Whilst 'with bells on' is largely reserved as being an enthusiastic response or as indicating additional ornament, both it and 'with (brass) knobs on' are also used as aggressive responses to a challenge. One might hear all of these in conversation - or rather one might have heard, as all versions are now falling out of use:"Your 21st? - I'll be there with bells on". "Little Richard; he's like Jerry Lee Lewis with bells/brass knobs on" and"You incompetent dummy!". "Same to you with bells/brass knobs on!".The knobs in the above are fairly easy to identify. The allusion is to the iron bedsteads which were commonplace items of furniture at the time the term was coined. The better class examples were embellished with brass knobs at the top of each bedpost. The 'bells' derivation is less clear-cut. Bells are often used to indicate ornament or exuberance, as in the late 20th century phrase 'bells and whistles' and the earlier British expression 'pull the other one [leg], it's got bells on'. The explanation most often put forward as the source of the bells in 'with bells on' is that they were those worn as part of jesters' costumes. The 'going to a party' scenario certainly fits with that. However, the distance in time and place between the world of mediaeval court jesters and the emergence of the phrase in 20th century USA tends to call that explanation into question. Another speculative suggestion along similar lines is that the bells are the bell-bottomed trousers that were worn by sailors. The US Navy and the British Royal Navy both issued bell-bottoms for their sailors in the 19th century but, that aside, there's nothing to support a naval origin. 'Pull the other one, it's got bells on' seems an apt response there. A stronger contender comes from the settlement of US immigrants in Pennsylvania and other states. Their preferred means of transport were large, sturdy wooden carts, called Conestoga wagons. These were drawn by teams of horses or mules whose collars were fitted with headdresses of bells. George Stumway, in Conestoga Wagon 1750-1850, states that the wagoners personalised the bells to tunings of their liking and took great pride in them. If a wagon became stuck, a teamster who came to the rescue often asked for a set of bells as reward. Arriving at a destination without one's bells hurt a driver's professional pride, whereas getting there 'with bells on' was a source of satisfaction.That's not a conclusive proof of derivation but it offers better circumstantial evidence than the others.

Chop-chopMeaningBe quick; hurry up.OriginThis little reduplicated term has its origins in the South China Sea, as a Pidgin English version of the Chinese term k'w鈏-k'w鈏. The earliest known citation of chop-chop in print is from the English language newspaper that was printed in Canton in the early 19th century - The Canton Register, 13th May 1834:We have also... 'chop-chop hurry'. A slightly fuller account was printed two years later, in a monthly journal which was produced by and for American missionaries in Canton - The Chinese Repository. In January 1836 it contained an article headed 'Jargon Spoken in Canton', which included:"Chop-chop - pidgin Cantonese phrase for 'Hurry up!'"The adoption of the chop-chop pronunciation was influenced by the long-standing use of 'chop' and 'chop-up' by English seamen, with the meaning 'quick' or 'hurried'. This usage dates back to at least the 16th century, when it was commonly used in the strange expression - 'chopping-up the whiners'. This referred to gabbling through prayers in order to get them finished quickly. For example, from Philip Stubbes' The anatomie of abuses, 1583:Which maketh them [Reading ministers] to gallop it over as fast as they can, and to chop it up with all possible expedition, though none understand them.The seafaring usage of 'chop up' referred specifically to a sudden change in the wind and the waves. This also gives us of the term 'choppy' for turbulent water and is a constituent part of the expression 'chop and change'. 'Chop-up' was recorded by Sir William Monson in Naval Tracts, 1642:"The Wind would chop up Westerly." One of the many other meanings of the word chop is 'to eat; to snap up' - i.e. 'to take into the chops' (the jaws/cheeks/mouth). It would be a reasonable conjecture that this was the source of the word 'chop-sticks'. Reasonable, but not correct. It is the 17th century sailor's slang use of 'chop' to mean 'quick' which lead to chop-sticks. The nimbleness of the Chinese in their eating without the aid of forks caused the seamen to coin the term 'quick-sticks' or chop-sticks'. William Dampier recorded this in 1699 in A New Voyage Round the World:"At their ordinary eating they [the Chinese] use two small round sticks about the length and bigness of a Tobacco-pipe. They hold them both in the right hand, one between the fore-finger and thumb; the other between the middle-finger and fore-finger... they are called by the English seamen Chopsticks."This is in line with the original Chinese meaning. The Chinese name for chop-sticks is k'w鈏-tsze, which translates literally as 'nimble boys' or 'nimble ones'.Apart from in travelogues of the Far-East, there is little recorded mention of chop-sticks in English until the mid 20th century. The term 'quicksticks' however, did make it back to Britain in the 19th century, as an imperative meaning 'hurry up; do it without delay'. John C. Hotten recorded this in A dictionary of modern slang, 1859:"Quick sticks, in a hurry, rapidly; 'to cut quick sticks', to be in a great hurry."

Fight fire with fireMeaningRespond to an attack by using a similar method as one's attacker.OriginWhen we 'fight fire with fire' we are likely to employ more extreme methods than we would normally do. That was also the case with the actual fire-fighting that was the source of this phrase. US settlers in the 19th century, who originated the phrase, attempted to guard against grass or forest fires by deliberately raising small controllable fires, which they called 'back-fires', to remove any flammable material in advance of a larger fire and so deprive it of fuel. This literal 'fighting fire with fire' was often successful, although the settlers' lack of effective fire control equipment meant that their own fires occasionally got out of control and made matters worse rather than better. One such failure was recorded in Caroline Kirkland's novel, based on her experiences of frontier Michigan in the 1840s, A New Home - Who'll Follow? Or, Glimpses of Western Life (written under the pseudonym of Mrs. Mary Clavers):The more experienced of the neighbours declared there was nothing now but to make a "back-fire!" So home-ward all ran, and set about kindling an opposing serpent which should "swallow up the rest;" but it proved too late. The flames only reached our stable and haystacks the sooner,The method has continued to be used however and foresters now routinely create roads or unplanted areas to act as fire-breaks in woodland that is at risk of fire. The term 'backfire' is now more often applied to plans that fail in a way that weren't intended. It wasn't used in that negative sense until the early 20th century and probably derives from the popping explosions that used to be commonly heard from the exhausts of faulty motor vehicles, not from forest 'back-fires' which ran out of control.The earliest usage of 'fight fire with fire' that I've found in print is in the US author Henry Tappan's 1852 reminiscence A Step from the New World to the Old, and Back Again:Smoking was universal among the men; generally cigars, not fine Havanas, but made of Dutch tobacco, and to me not very agreeable. I had some Havanas with me, and so I lighted one to make an atmosphere for myself: as the trappers on the prairies fight fire with fire, so I fought tobacco with tobacco.

A cock and bull storyMeaningA fanciful and unbelievable tale.OriginIt is widely reported that this phrase originated at Stony Stratford ("The Jewel of Milton Keynes"), Buckinghamshire, England. Visitors to Milton Keynes might feel the bar for 'jewel' status is set rather low in that region, although Stony Stratford is indeed a rather pleasant market town. Stony Stratford (the stony ford on the Roman road) is located on the old Roman road of Watling Street, now the A5. In the height of the coaching era - the 18th and early 19th centuries - Stony Stratford was an important stopping-off point for mail and passenger coaches travelling between London and the North of England. This coaching history is the source of the supposed origin of the phrase 'cock and bull story'. The Cock and the Bull were two of the main coaching inns in the town and the banter and rivalry between groups of travellers is said to have resulted in exaggerated and fanciful stories, which became known as 'cock and bull stories'. The two hostelries did, and still do, exist. By now, you may have noticed the 'widely reported' and 'supposed' adjectives above and picked up that I don't believe a word of it. Although it is an appealing story, regrettably, it is little more than that. There's no evidence whatsoever to connect the two inns with the phrase, apart from the coincidence of the two names. Whisper it not in Stony Stratford if you want to get out alive, but it's more likely that the phrase comes from old folk tales that featured magical animals. The early 17th century French term 'coq-a-l'ane' was defined in Randle Cotgrave's A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues, 1611 as:An incoherent story, passing from one subject to another.This was later taken up in Scots as "cockalayne", again with the same meaning. The first citation of 'cock and bull' stories in English is from Robert Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy, 1621:"Some mens whole delight is to talk of a Cock and Bull over a pot."This reference to 'a cock' and 'a bull', which is duplicated in all the early 17th and 18th century citations of the phrase, lends support to the view that the stories were about cocks and bulls, i.e. fanciful tales, rather than stories told in the Cock or the Bull. The early date doesn't entirely rule out the coaching inn story, as coaches were used for transport in England prior to 1621 and both establishments were in business before that date but, in my view, that derivation is a 20th century invention.What is missing from the Stony Stratford tale, and this is commonplace in folk-etymological sources that attempt to connect language with a particular place (see by hook and by crook, for example), is any link between the supposed origin and the meaning of the phrase. Why should patrons of the Cock and the Bull have been any more likely to make up fanciful tales than anyone else? Neither the Cock nor the Bull has distinguished itself in the making of the English language. The Bull now languishes under the outrageous 'InnFamous Bull' pun on its inn sign. The Cock, in addition to the 'cock and bull story', has another cock and bull story all to itself. It is said to be the source of the nursery rhyme line 'ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross'. The story goes that horses were hired at the Cock Inn by travellers on route to nearby Banbury. Again, this is tosh. A cockhorse has been a nursery term since at least the early 16th century, as this citation from Sir Thomas Elyot's The Image of Governance, 1540, indicates:"The dotyng pleasure to see my littell soonne ride on a cokhorse."It isn't clear whether cockhorses were originally sticks with horses' heads that children played with or a reference to children being bounced on the knee of an adult. What they were definitely not were horses hired from a pub thirty miles away. I must close now; the paramilitary wing of the Stony Stratford tourist office is on my tail...

Bats in the belfryMeaningCrazy; eccentric. OriginBats are, of course, the erratically flying mammals and 'belfries' are bell towers, sometimes found at the top of churches. 'Bats in the belfry' refers to someone who acts as though he has bats careering around his topmost part, i.e. his head.It has the sound of a phrase from Olde Englande and it certainly has the imagery to fit into any number of Gothic novels based in English parsonages or turreted castles. In fact, it comes from the USA; nor is it especially old. All the early citations are from American authors and date from the start of the 20th century. For example, this piece from the Ohio newspaper The Newark Daily Advocate, October 1900:To his hundreds of friends and acquaintances in Newark, these purile [sic] and senseless attacks on Hon. John W. Cassingham are akin to the vaporings of the fellow with a large flock of bats in his belfry."Ambrose Bierce, also American, used the term in a piece for Cosmopolitan Magazine, in July 1907, describing it as a new curiosity:"He was especially charmed with the phrase 'bats in the belfry', and would indubitably substitute it for 'possessed of a devil', the Scriptural diagnosis of insanity."The use of 'bats' and 'batty' to denote odd behaviour originated around the same time as 'bats in the belfry' and they are clearly related. Again, the first authors to use the words are American: 1903 A. L. Kleberg - Slang Fables from Afar: "She ... acted so queer ... that he decided she was Batty."1919 Fannie Hurst - Humoresque: "'Are you bats?' she said."There have been several attempts over the years to associate the term 'batty' with various people called Batty or Battie, notably the 18th century physician William Battie. He was a governor of the Bethlem Hospital, a.k.a. Bedlam, and physician to St Luke's Hospital for Lunaticks, where he wrote A Treatise on Madness. Despite those illustrious credentials, it was bats rather than Battie that caused scatterbrained people to be called 'batty'.

Upside downMeaningTurned so that the upper surface becomes the lower. Origin'Upside down' is one of a longish list of English expressions that refer to things being inverted or in disorder - 'topsy-turvy', 'head over heels' (even though that is the usual arrangement), '**** over tea-kettle' etc. The mediaeval English also had the terms 'overset', 'overtumble' and 'topset downe', which have now gone out of use. This profusion of similar phrases suggests a widespread interest in the recounting of stories of people falling over - matched today by the popularity of home video television shows. The interest is common in other languages too; the French even have a specialist term for a sequence of stamps in which some are printed upside down - t阾e-b阠he.'Upside down' was originally 'up so down', i.e. 'up as if down'. The 'so' part migrated into various forms, 'upsa', 'upse' (which spawned 'upset') etc., in the same way as in phrases like 'ups-a-daisy' and 'upset the applecart'. The change from 'up so down' to forms like 'upset-down' and eventually 'upside-down' appear to be for no better reason than to make the expression's meaning more intuitive. 'Upside down' doesn't sound especially old but, in its early forms, it can claim to be one of the oldest expressions in English. It joins the handful of phrases that can be dated from the first part of the 14th century or before, for example, 'haven't slept a wink', 'in the twinkling of an eye', 'by dint of'. The earliest version of 'upside down' known in print is in The proces of the seuyn [seven] sages. The precise publication date of that text isn't known, but it is accepted as being before 1340:"The cradel and the child thai found Up so doun upon the ground."(Note: The '****' above is the upshot of the policy of many ISPs of blocking all mail which contains words that they have decided might give you a fit of the vapours. Apologies to the many subscribers who didn't get recent '**** and bull story' mailing.)

Warts and allMeaningThe whole thing; not concealing the less attractive parts.OriginThis phrase is said to derive from Oliver Cromwell's instructions to the painter Sir Peter Lely, when commissioning a portrait.At the time of the alleged instruction, Cromwell was Lord Protector of England. Lely had been portrait artist to Charles I and, following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, he was appointed as Charles II's Principal Painter in Ordinary. Lely's painting style was, as was usual at the time, intended to flatter the sitter. Royalty in particular expected portraits to show them in the best possible light, if not to be outright fanciful. Lely's painting of Charles II shows what was expected of a painting of a head of state in the 17th century. It emphasizes the shapely royal calves - a prized fashion feature at that time. Cromwell did have a preference for being portrayed as a gentleman of military bearing, but was well-known as being opposed to all forms of personal vanity. This 'puritan Roundhead' versus 'dashing Cavalier' shorthand is often used to denote the differences in style of the two opposing camps in the English Commonwealth and subsequent Restoration. It is entirely plausible that he would have issued a 'warts and all' instruction when being painted and it is unlikely that Lely would have modified his style and produced the 'warts and all' portrait of Cromwell unless someone told him to.We have Cromwell's death mask as a reference. From that it is clear that Lely's portrait is an accurate record of Cromwell's actual appearance. Despite the plausibility of the account, there doesn't appear to be any convincing evidence that Cromwell ever used the phrase 'warts and all'. The first record of a version of that phrase being attributed to him comes from Horace Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting in England, 1764. Walpole's authority for the attribution came from a reported conversation between John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, the first occupant of Buckingham House, now Buckingham Palace, and the house's architect, Captain William Winde. Winde claimed that:Oliver certainly sat to him, and while sitting, said to him - "Mr Lely, I desire you would use all your skill to paint my picture truly like me, and not flatter me at all; but remark all these roughnesses, pimples, warts and everything as you see me, otherwise I will never pay a farthing for it."That was published in 1764 - over a hundred years after Lely painted Cromwell. Walpole included no evidence to support the attribution, nor any explanation of why no one else had mentioned the phrase in the preceding hundred years - this despite Cromwell's life being the subject of minutely detailed historical research and over 160 full-length biographies. We can only assume he was indulging in a piece of literary speculation rather than historical documentation. The first known citation in print of the actual phrase 'warts and all' is from a 'Chinese whisper' retelling of Walpole's story - an address given by an Alpheus Cary, in Massachusetts, in 1824:When Cromwell sat for his portrait he said, "Paint me as I am, warts and all!" It may well be the case that Oliver Cromwell preferred portraits of him to be accurate, but it is most unlikely that he ever uttered the words 'warts and all'.

As easy as pieMeaningVery easy.OriginThere are many similes in English that have the form 'as X as Y'. These almost always highlight some property - X, and give an example of something that is well-known to display that property - Y. For example, 'as white as snow', 'as dead as a dodo' and, risking a group slander action from our noble friends, 'as drunk as a lord'. How though, are pies thought to be easy? They aren't especially easy to make; I know, I've tried it. The easiness comes with the eating. At least, that was the view in 19th century America, where this phrase was coined. There are various mid 19th century US citations that, whilst not using 'as easy as pie' verbatim, do point to 'pie' being used to denote pleasantry and ease. 'Pie' in this sense is archetypally American, as American as apple pie in fact. The usage first comes in the phrase 'as nice as pie', as found here in Which: Right or Left? in 1855:"For nearly a week afterwards, the domestics observed significantly to each other, that Miss Isabella was as 'nice as pie!'"Mark Twain frequently used just 'pie' to mean pleasant or accommodating: In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, 1884, "You're always as polite as pie to them.""So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice,... and was just old pie to him, so to speak."Pie was also used at that time for something that was easy to accomplish. For example, The US magazine Sporting Life, May 1886:"As for stealing second and third, it's like eating pie."'Pie in the sky', also an American phrase from around the same time, refers to 'pie' as something pleasant that we will receive eventually. The earliest example of the actual phrase 'as easy as pie' that I can find comes from the Rhode Island newspaper The Newport Mercury, June 1887 - in a comic story about two down and outs in New York:"You see veuever I goes I takes away mit me a silverspoon or a knife or somethings, an' I gets two or three dollars for them. It's easy as pie. Vy don't you try it?" Pie seems to rank right up there with cake in the US lexicon of ease and pleasantry - 'a piece of cake', 'take the cake', 'cake-walk' are all American phrases from the 19th century.

In a cleft stickMeaningIn a position where advance and retreat are both impossible; in a fix.OriginWhen we cleave something we split it into two pieces and it is then said to be 'cleft' or 'cloven'. These archaic-sounding words aren't commonly used alone these days and only persist in phrases like 'cleft-palate', 'cloven-hoofed' and 'in a cleft stick'. Cleft sticks are those which are split at one end, i.e. forked sticks. These were used as simple tools for carrying small items such as bundles of paper or candles. Jonathan Swift makes a reference to such in his 'Directions to Servants' in Works, circa 1745:"You may conveniently stick your candle in a bottle, or with a lump of butter against the wainscot, in a powder-horn, or in an old shoe, or in a cleft stick."Swift's use, although hardly serious, is a literal one and doesn't suggest the figurative use, which is first recorded in the correspondence in William Cowper's Works, 1782:"We are squeezed to death, between the two sides of that sort of alternative which is commonly called a cleft stick."'In a cleft stick' originated in the UK and its use elsewhere is limited. How then did it come to mean 'in a difficult situation, unable to move'? As is so often the case, there is more than one theory. Theory One has it that cleft sticks were used to capture snakes, pinning them to the ground so that they were unable to move. Theory Two suggests that cleft pegs were used to punish over-talkative women, pinching their tongues so that they were unable to speak. The first theory has the advantage of closely matching the meaning of the phrase - snakes certainly are sometimes caught and made immobile using split sticks. Also, the first citation of the use of a cleft stick to catch a snake predates references in other contexts. That comes in the Review of the Works of the Royal Society of London, 1751, in which Captain Silas Taylor described 'A Way to Kill Rattlesnakes':Procure a cleft Stick, and put into the Notch of it, a Quantity of the bruised Leaves of wild Pennyroyal; direct the End of the Stick towards the Serpent's Nose; as he avoids it, still pursue him with it; and in half an Hour's Time he will be killed by the mere Scent of the Herb. It is unlikely that the English antiquary Taylor ever came within a stick's length of a rattlesnake and his rather roundabout method of dispatching them isn't quite the evidence we are looking for. On to Theory Two. In 16th century England, any women who was considered to be a scold, i.e. a user of abusive or ribald language, especially against her husband, was in danger of being punished in a fearsome apparatus called a 'branks', also known as a 'scold's bridle' or gossip's bridle'. The device was an iron cage with a tongue that projected into the mouth of the victim and prevented speech. They A branks might look like a prop from a Ye Olde Englande B-feature, but they were widely used punishments throughout the Middle Ages. In 1890, when William Andrews published Old-time Punishments, Walton-on-Thames Parish Church had such a device on display. It was dated 1632 and inscribed with this little couplet:Chester presents Walton with a bridleTo curb women's tongues that talk too idle.The early English settlers to the USA didn't bring these punishment devices with them and other methods for chastising unruly women were used there. The Records of the Town of East-Hampton, 1639-1680, transcribed and published in 1883, record the use of the alternative 'cleft stick' method in the case of a woman described as "very ignorant, selfish and imperious":February 2, 1652. "It is ordered that Goody Edwards shal pay ? or have her tongue in a cleft sticke for the Contempt of a warent." In addition to their superficial plausibility, what the two theories given above have in common is an American source. The phrase isn't American though and doesn't appear in print there until many years after Cowper's 1782 citation. It is more likely that 'in a cleft stick' never did refer to a specific item but to the general condition of immobility when stuck between a cleft stick's jaws.

Come a cropperMeaningFall over or fail at some venture.OriginThe word crop derives from the Old Norse word kropp, which was the name of a hump or swelling on the body. The OED graphically describes a crop as a 'swollen protuberance or excrescence'. This later modified into meaning any swollen or rounded item, for example, a bird's gullet, the seed head of a ripe plant (the source of the word crop as applied to cereals etc.) or, spelled as croup, the rear end of a horse - also called the crupper. 'Come a cropper' is one from the list of British phrases that is associated in the popular imagination with Victorian inventors. These include the various phrases based on the name of Thomas Crapper, the sanitary engineer and 'bats in the belfry', reportedly coined after George Bateson. Henry Smith Cropper is the man supposedly the source of 'come a cropper'. Unlike Bateson, who turns out to be an invented inventor, Cropper, like Crapper, did actually exist. Indeed he was a prominent enough citizen to become Sheriff of Nottingham. He didn't occupy his time in chasing outlaws around the local forests though. H. S. Cropper and Co. began selling the Minerva platen printing press in 1866. It was a successful design and before long all platen presses were known as croppers. It is suggested that 'come a cropper' derives from the accidents that print workers had when catching their fingers between the plates of the presses. Like the Bateson story, this is an appealing tale. There's no truth to it though - it's just another invention. For the actual derivation we need to consider the nether quarters of a horse - the croup or crupper. In the 18th century, anyone who took a headlong fall from a horse was said to have fallen 'neck and crop'. For example, this extract from the English poet Edward Nairne's Poems, 1791:A man on horseback, drunk with gin and flip,Bawling out - Yoix - and cracking of his whip, ...The startish beast took fright, and flopThe mad-brain'd rider tumbled, neck and crop! 'Neck and crop' and 'head over heels' probably both derive from the 16th century term 'neck and heels', which had the same meaning. 'Come a cropper' is just a colloquial way of describing a 'neck and crop' fall. The phrase is first cited in Robert S. Surtees' Ask Mamma, 1858:[He] "rode at an impracticable fence, and got a cropper for his pains."By the time John C. Hotten published his A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words in 1859, the phrase has come to refer to any failure rather than just the specific failure to stay on a horse:"Cropper, 'to go a cropper', or 'to come a cropper', i.e., to fail badly."

Chip on your shoulderMeaningA perceived grievance or sense of inferiority.OriginThe word chip has several meanings; the one that we are concerned with here is the earliest known of these, namely 'a small piece of wood, as might be chopped, or chipped, from a larger block'. The phrase 'a chip on one's shoulder' is reported as originating with the nineteenth century U.S. practice of spoiling for a fight by carrying a chip of wood on one's shoulder, daring others to knock it off. This suggested derivation has more than the whiff of folk-etymology about it. Anyone who might be inclined to doubt that origin can take heart from an alternative theory. This relates to working practices in the British Royal Dockyards in the 18th century. In Day and Lunn's The History of Work and Labour Relations in the Royal Dockyards, 1999, the authors report that the standing orders of the [Royal] Navy Board for August 1739 included this ruling:"Shipwrights to be allowed to bring [chips] on their shoulders near to the dock gates, there to be inspected by officers".The permission to remove surplus timber for firewood or building material was a substantial perk of the job for the dock workers. A subsequent standing order, in May 1753, ruled that only chips that could be carried under one arm were allowed to be removed. This limited the amount of timber that could be taken and the shipwrights were not best pleased about the revoking of their previous benefit. Three years later, for this and other reasons, they went on strike. Hattendorf, Knight et al., in British Naval Documents, 1204 - 1960, record a letter which was sent by Chatham Dockyard officers to the Navy Board, relating to the 1756 dockyard workers' strike at Chatham. The letter records a comment made by a shipwright who was stopped at the yard's gates:"Are not the chips mine? I will not lower them." It goes on to report that "Immediately the main body pushed on with their chips on their shoulders." That's a nice story and does connect an incident concerning chips and shoulders with a belligerent attitude. We need to be a little wary of swallowing that derivation whole however. The problem with it is that the phrase isn't known to be recorded in print in England with its figurative meaning anywhere near the 18th century. The first such record by an English author doesn't seem to be until the 1930s in fact, in Somerset Maugham's Gentleman in the Parlour:"He was a man with a chip on his shoulder. Everyone seemed in a conspiracy to slight or injure him."A gap of nearly 200 years between the use of a phrase and the incident that supposedly spawned it in the same country is hard to explain. In my humble opinion, the 'chips on shoulders' report dating from 1756 refer literally to just that, chips carried on shoulders. There's no evidence at all to suggest 'a chip on one's shoulder' existed as a figurative phrase until the 19th century. The confrontational challenge to knock a chip of wood off someone's shoulder does after all appear to be the correct derivation. Circumstantial evidence is all we have to go on here, but that clearly points to a 19th century US coinage. The earliest printed citations that I can find that refer to chips on shoulders are all from America, which the OED states quite firmly to be the source of the phrase. For example: The American writer and historian James Kirke Paulding's Letters from the South, 1817:"A man rode furiously by on horseback, and swore he'd be d----d if he could not lick any man who dared to crook his elbow at him. This, it seems, is equivalent to throwing the glove in days of yore, or to the boyish custom of knocking a chip off the shoulder."In 1830 the New York newspaper The Long Island Telegraph printed this:"When two churlish boys were determined to fight, a chip would be placed on the shoulder of one, and the other demanded to knock it off at his peril."The actual phrase 'chip on his shoulder' appears a little later, in the Weekly Oregonian 1855:"Leland, in his last issue, struts out with a chip on his shoulder, and dares Bush to knock it off."

Tide overMeaningMake a small allowance (of money, food etc.) last until stocks are replenished. OriginMy attention was drawn to the little phrase 'tide over' on 'Meltdown Monday' - 15th September 2008, when Robert Peston, the BBC's Business Editor, posted this on his blog: "As for the US central banking system, the Fed, it is endeavouring to minimise the damage to the financial system from these shocks by allowing securities firms to swap shares for short-term loans, to tied them over."As is the norm with the BBC's audience, the 'tied over' misspelling produced a much more impassioned response than the chaos in the world's financial system. It may well have been merely a typo - 'e' and 'd' are next to each other on QWERTY keyboards after all. The correct spelling is of course 'tide over'. On reflection, 'tide over' doesn't seem any more intuitive than 'tied over'; so what is the origin of the phrase? 'Tiding over', i.e. the eking out of a small stock until a larger supply arrives, doesn't at first sight appear to have any direct connection with tidal waters. That's because the meaning of this phrase has changed slightly over the years. The original 'tiding over' was a seafaring term. The literal meaning was 'in the absence of wind to fill the sails, float with the tide'. This usage was recorded by the English seaman Captain John Smith. Smith is best known for his role in establishing the first permanent English settlement in North America at Jamestown, Virginia. In addition to that achievement, he had more luck as a mariner than his namesake John Edward Smith, the master of the Titanic. His status as a sailing authority was established by his writing the influential sailor's manual A Sea Grammar, 1627, which includes this earliest known citation of 'tide over': "To Tide ouer to a place, is to goe ouer with the Tide of ebbe or flood, and stop the contrary by anchoring till the next Tide."That sense of tiding over, in which ships would tide over here and tide over there, was superseded by a 'coping with a short-term problem' meaning. This meaning drew on the imagery of ships floating over a obstacle on a swelling tide. Our present figurative usage of that image was established by the early 19th century, as in the Earl of Dudley's Letters to the Bishop of Llandaff, 1821:"I wish we may be able to tide over this difficulty."

Hedge your betsMeaningTo avoid committing oneself; to leave a means of retreat open. OriginHedge has been used as a verb in English since at least the 16th century, with the meaning of 'equivocate; avoid commitment'. An example of this comes in Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor, 1598:"I, I, I myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge and to lurch ."It began to be used in relation to financial transactions, in which a loan was secured by including it in a larger loan, in the early 17th century. Initially, the phrase associated with this form of hedging was 'hedging one's debts', for example, John Donne's Letters to Sir Henry Goodyere, circa 1620:"You think that you have Hedged in that Debt by a greater, by your Letter in Verse."'Hedging one's bets' was coined later in that century. It referred to the laying off of a bet by taking out smaller bets with other lenders. The purpose of this was to avoid being unable to pay out on the original larger bet. The phrase was first used by George Villiers, the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, in his satirical play The Rehearsal, 1672:"Now, Criticks, do your worst, that here are met; For, like a Rook, I have hedg'd in my Bet."The verb 'to hedge' derives from the noun hedge, i.e. a fence made from a row of bushes or trees. These hedges were normally made from the spiny Hawthorn, which makes an impenetrable hedge when laid. To hedge a piece of land was to limit it in terms of size and that this gave rise to the 'secure, limited risk' meaning. Hedge funds, much in the news nowadays, take their name from their method of limiting, i.e. hedging, their risk. Curiously, the original examples of another financial device currently newsworthy i.e. stocks, were literally made from material that was taken from hedges. In the 17th century, the tally that recorded a payment to the English Exchequer was a rough stick of about an inch in diameter, split along its length. One half, the stock, was given as a receipt to the person making the payment; the other half, the counterfoil, was kept by the Exchequer. Ownership of payments that were made jointly by a group were shared among the members of so-called joint stock companies, hence stocks and shares.

An Englishman's home is his castleMeaningThe English dictum that a man's home is his refuge. OriginThe maxim that 'An Englishman's home (or occasionally, house) is his castle' is most often cited these days in articles in the British right-wing press that bemoan the apparent undermining of the perceived principle that a man can do as he pleases in his own house, which they hold up as an ancient right. The grumbles centre about the feminist 'what about Englishwomen?' response and the public disquiet about the smacking of children, attacking of intruders etc. The proverb was used in almost all of the articles about the court case of Tony Martin in 2000. Martin was convicted by jury trial of murder, after shooting and killing a 16-year old who had broken into his house in Norfolk, UK. Did Englishmen actually ever have a unique right to act as they please within the walls of their own home? Well, yes and no. Yes, in the sense that it has been a legal precept in England, since at least the 17th century, that no one may enter a home, which would typically then have been in male ownership, unless by invitation. This was established as common law by the lawyer and politician Sir Edward Coke (pronounced Cook), in The Institutes of the Laws of England, 1628:"For a man's house is his castle, et domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium [and each man's home is his safest refuge]."This enshrined into law the popular belief at the time, which was expressed in print by several authors in the late 16th century, including Richard Mulcaster, the headmaster of Merchant Taylors' School in London, in his treatise on education - Positions, which are necessarie for the training up of children, 1581:"He [the householder] is the appointer of his owne circumstance, and his house is his castle."Judged against the standards of his time, Mulcaster was an enlightened educationalist. His charges were nevertheless terrified of him and he condoned methods in the 'castle' of his school that would result these days in a visit from Social Services. His own experience in castles wasn't that happy either. He was imprisoned for theft in 1555 in the Tower of London and probably tortured into a confession. What was meant by 'castle' was defined in 1763 by the British Prime Minister with an admirable selection of names to choose from - William Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, a.k.a. Pitt the Elder:"The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the crown. It may be frail - its roof may shake - the wind may blow through it - the storm may enter - the rain may enter - but the King of England cannot enter."It is clear from the above that the law was established to give householders the right to prevent entry to their homes. Like the 'rule of thumb', which was popularly and mistakenly believed to be the right of a man to beat his wife, the 'Englishman's home is his castle' rule didn't establish a man's right to take actions inside the home that would be illegal outside it. The principle was exported to the United States where, not unnaturally, the 'Englishman' was removed from the phrase. In 1800, Joel Chandler Harris's biography of Henry W. Grady, the journalist and writer on the US Constitution, included this line:"Exalt the citizen. As the State is the unit of government he is the unit of the State. Teach him that his home is his castle, and his sovereignty rests beneath his hat."These days, with all the news of banking collapses and mortgage foreclosures, men and women, English or American, might be glad to have somewhere to call home, even if they have to obey the law when inside it.

Many a little makes a mickleMeaningMany small amounts accumulate to make a large amount.OriginA mickle, or as they prefer it in Scotland, a muckle, means 'great or large in size'. Apart from 'many a little (or pickle) makes a mickle' the words only now remain in use in UK place-names, like Muckle Flugga in Shetland (which amply lives up to its translated name of 'large, steep-sided island') and Mickleover in Derbyshire (listed in the Domesday Book as Magna Oufra - 'large village on the hill'). 'Over' and 'upper' are very common prefixes in English place-names, along with their opposites 'under', 'lower', 'nether' or 'little'. Examples of these are the Cotswold villages of Upper and Lower Slaughter, and the Hampshire villages of Over and Nether Wallop. The word 'much' derives from the Old English 'mickle' and has now almost entirely replaced it. 'Much' is also used in place-names like Much Wenlock, Shropshire (there's also a Little Wenlock, of course). The proverbial phrase 'many a little makes a mickle' has now itself been largely superseded by the 18th century 'look after the pennies (originally, 'take care of the pence'), and the pounds will look after ('take care of') themselves'. The first mention in print of what was undoubtedly an older proverb comes in a 1614 work by William Camden, with a rather desultory title - Remaines of a greater worke concerning Britaine, 1605:"Many a little makes a micle."In the next century it was taken across the Atlantic by George Washington, who included it in Writings, 1793:"A Scotch [steady on George, I think they prefer to be called Scots] addage, than which nothing in nature is more true 'that many mickles make a muckle'."The phrase's variant form 'many a mickle makes a muckle' is also sometimes heard. This 20th century version is actually nonsensical as it derives from the misapprehension that mickle and muckle, rather than meaning the same thing, mean 'small' and 'large' respectively.

In limbo MeaningIn a state of being neglected and immobile, with no prospect of movement to a better place. OriginFor those of a certain age, limbo is now most often associated with the party dance, in which dancers bend backwards and shuffle under a horizontal stick without touching it. This originated in the West Indies the 1950s and became something of a fad in the 1960s. The craze was created, or the uncharitable might say, cashed in on, by Chubby Checker, who released the single Limbo Rock and the album Limbo Party in 1962. The adjective 'limber' has been in use in English since the 16th century, with the meaning 'pliant and supple; easily bent'. There's no definitive documented link between limber and limbo, but it seems very probable that they are actually versions of the same word. People had been in limbo well before the 1950s, of course. Limbo was originally a place rather than a dance - the borders of Hell, no less. That limbo derived from the Latin 'limbus', meaning edge. Mediaeval Christian belief had it that only those who were baptized into the Christian Church could enter Heaven. Theologists, especially those of the Roman Catholic persuasion, were much exercised by the fate of those who, while not being sinners to be condemned to Hell, were unbaptized through no fault of their own. In particular, babies who died at birth or those who had died before the time of Christ, would have had no choice but to remain unbaptized. By the 14th century, the incongruity was avoided via the concept of Limbo, the abode of righteous souls who weren't destined for either Heaven or Hell. Two of the forms of Limbo were Limbo Infantum (Limbo of the Infants) and Limbo Patrum (Limbo of the Adults).Thus, Limbo was on the border, not in Hell, but not in Heaven either, and 'in limbo' later came to take on the metaphorical meaning - 'in prison'. Shakespeare used this in Henry VIII, 1613:I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they are like to dance these three days. Soon after that, the meaning was extended to our current usage, which refers to any situation where someone or some project is confined and neglected, with nowhere to go until something happens to restart it. This was alluded to in John Milton's An Apology..., 1642, in which he refuted an attack that had been made on a Presbyterian group known as Smectymnuus:"I am met with a whole ging of words and phrases not mine, for he hath maimed them and ... mangled them in this his wicked limbo."Mediaeval belief had it that the spirits of those in limbo were all around us (and many still believe this). These days, Limbo remains close by. 'In limbo' is the name that computer scientists give to the condition of files which are deleted from view but not yet physically removed from storage - like those in the Windows' Recycle Bin.

Jump on the bandwagonMeaningJoin a growing movement in support of someone or something, often in an opportunist way, when that movement is seen to have become successful.OriginThe word bandwagon was coined in the USA in the mid 19th century, simply as the name for the wagon that carried a circus band. Phineas T. Barnum, the great showman and circus owner, used the term in 1855 in his unambiguously named autobiography The Life of P.T. Barnum, Written by Himself, 1855:"At Vicksburg we sold all our land conveyances excepting four horses and the 'band wagon'."Barnum didn't coin 'jump on the bandwagon', which came later, but he did have a hand in some other additions to the language. He was nothing if not a publicist and, even though there is no definitive evidence of his inventing any new word or phrase, he certainly can be said to have made several of them popular. Firstly, there are a couple of celebrated quotations:"There's a sucker born every minute." and "You may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you can't fool all of the people all the time." The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations lists those under their Barnum entry, along with the dictionary compiler's favourite weasel words - "attributed to". There is considerable doubt that he said either of the above. Barnum's acquaintances have claimed that the first would have been somewhat out of character for him, and Abraham Lincoln is often confidently cited as the author of the second. Actually, the 'some of the people' dictum isn't found in print until 1887 (some years after Lincoln's death and when Barnum was in his dotage), when it appears in print in several American newspapers, again guarded by vagaries like "Lincoln once said".Two other terms that we certainly can thank Barnum for popularising are 'Jumbo' and 'Siamese twins'. Jumbo was a little-used slang term in Barnum's day and was recorded in John Badcock's Slang. A dictionary of the turf, 1823:"Jumbo, a clumsy or unwieldly fellow."The word was coined as the the name of a giant elephant that was housed at London Zoo. Jumbo was sold to Barnum in 1882 and exhibited in his shows. It is via Barnum's marketing zeal that the word became widely used as epitomising hugeness. The creature itself didn't have much luck. It died in 1885 after being struck by a train. Its heart was cut out and the torso was stuffed and mounted and continued to tour with Barnum's circus. It was destroyed in a fire in 1975 and now languishes as 14 ounces of ash in a peanut butter jar. Barnum's other contribution to the language is the term 'Siamese twins', which he applied to the 'joined at the hip' brothers Chang and Eng Bunker.Back to the bandwagon. Circus workers were skilled at attracting the public with the razzmatazz of a parade through town, complete with highly decorated bandwagons. In the late 19th century, politicians picked up on this form of attracting a crowd and began using bandwagons when campaigning for office. The transition from the literal 'jumping on a bandwagon', in order to show one's alliance to a politician, to the figurative use we know now was complete by the 1890s. Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt made a clear-cut reference to the practice in his Letters, 1899 (published 1951):"When I once became sure of one majority they tumbled over each other to get aboard the band wagon."

Graveyard shiftMeaningA late-night/early-morning work shift.OriginI am loath to do it, as there may just be someone who will take the following passage as literal truth, but here's a reprint of the last (and quite possibly the least) paragraph of the collection of invented and untrue twaddle that has been circulating on the Internet for some time, under the name of 'Life in the 1500s':England is old and small and they started running out of places to bury people. So they would dig up coffins and would take the bones to a "bone-house" and reuse the grave. When reopening these coffins, one out of 25 coffins were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realized they had been burying people alive. So they thought they would tie a string on the wrist of the corpse, lead it through the coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone would have to sit out in the graveyard all night (the "graveyard shift") to listen for the bell; thus, someone could be "saved by the bell" or was considered a "dead ringer."We have debunked the saved by the bell and dead ringer myths previously, so now let's take a look at 'graveyard shift'. Given that the derivation of the phrases 'saved by the bell' and 'dead ringer' had nothing whatever to do with burials or graveyards, it might be thought that 'graveyard shift' could be dismissed without further investigation. That may be a little hasty. Those phrases may have had nothing to do with bells being attached to coffins to guard against premature burial, but such devices did exist and were occasionally used. Given that some people had sufficient fear of being buried alive to invest in such coffins, it is at least plausible that they would also have made arrangements for someone to monitor the grave so that their coffin's bell could be heard in the event of them ringing it. Nevertheless, and as usual with phrase etymology, plausibility and truth are only distant relatives.The Graveyard Shift, or Graveyard Watch, was the name coined for the work shift of the early morning, typically midnight until 8am. The name originated in the USA at the latter end of the 1800s. There's no evidence at all that it had anything directly to do with watching over graveyards, merely that the shifts took place in the middle of the night, when the ambience was quiet and lonely. The earliest example of the phrase in print that I have found is in the US newspaper The Salt Lake Tribune, June 1897:The police changed shifts for the month yesterday. This month Sergeant Ware takes the morning relief. Sergeant Matt Rhodes the middle and Sergeant John Burbidge the graveyard shift.The 'graveyard watch' version of the phrase was normally used by sailors on watch - hardly a group in a position to supervise buried coffins. The graveyard link was made explicit in this definition, offered by the American mariner Gershom Bradford, in A Glossary of Sea Terms, 1927:"Graveyard watch, the middle watch or 12 to 4 a.m., because of the number of disasters that occur at this time."One more nail in the coffin of folk etymology, let's hope, or can I still hear a faint bell clanking in the Internet graveyard?

Dressed to the ninesMeaningDressed flamboyantly or smartly.OriginNine is, without doubt, the most troublesome number in etymology. Phrases of uncertain parentage that include 'nine' are 'cloud nine' and the infamous 'whole nine yards'. To those we can add 'dressed to the nines'.Numerous attempts have been made to associate the number nine with clothing and so to explain the phrase's derivation. One theory has it that tailors used nine yards of material to make a suit (or according to some authors, a shirt). The more material you had the more status, although nine yards seems generous even for a fop. Another commonly repeated explanation comes from the exquisitely smart uniforms of the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot, which was raised in 1824. The problem with these explanations is that they come with no evidence to support them, apart from a reference to the number nine (or 99, which seems to be stretching the cloth rather thinly). The regiment was in business in the early 19th century, which is at least the right sort of date for a phrase that became widely used in the middle of that century. The first example of the use of the phrase that I can find in print is an extract from the New York Herald, 1837:"One evening a smart young mechanic, 'dressed to the nines', as Ben Bowline says, might have been seen wending his way along Broadway." What counts against the above explanations, and indeed against any of the supposed explanations that attempt to link the number nine to some property of clothing, is the prior use of the shorter phrase 'to the nine' or 'to the nines', which was used to indicate perfection, the highest standards. That was in use in the 18th century, well before 'dressed to the nines' was first used, as in this example from William Hamilton's Epistle to Ramsay, 1719:The bonny Lines therein thou sent me,How to the nines they did content me.It is worth noting that the number nine has long been used as a superlative. Classical mythology gave us the Nine Muses of Arts and Learning. The Nine Worthies were characters drawn from the Pagan and Jewish history and from the Bible. This distinguished group consisted of Hector, Alexander, Julius Caesar, Joshua, David, Judas Maccabaeus, King Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey of Bouillon. The Nine Worthies, usually called simply The Nine, were well-known to mediaeval scholars as the personification of all that was noble and heroic. The Poetick Miscellenies of Mr John Rawlett, 1687, provides the earliest reference to 'to the Nine' that I can find: The learned tribe whose works the World do bless,Finish those works in some recess;Both the Philosopher and Divine,And Poets most who still make their addressIn private to the Nine.It seems clear that 'the Nine' that Rawlett was referring to were the Nine Worthies. It is just as clear that 'dressed to the nines' is merely an extension of 'to the nine/s' and that we could equally well say 'danced to the nines' or 'embroidered to the nines' to appreciate good dancing or embroidery. It isn't surprising that the search for the link between 'nines' and dress sense has unearthed no convincing candidates - call off the dogs; there is no such link.

Worth one's saltMeaningTo be effective and efficient; deserving of one's pay. OriginSodium chloride, a.k.a. salt, is essential for human life and, until the invention of canning and refrigeration, was the primary method of preservation of food. Not surprisingly, it has long been considered valuable. To be 'worth one's salt' is to be worth one's pay. Our word salary derives from the Latin salarium, (sal is the Latin word for salt). There is some debate over the origin of the word salarium, but most scholars accept that it was the money allowed to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt. Roman soldiers weren't actually paid in salt, as some suggest. They were obliged to buy their own food, weapons etc. and had the cost of these deducted from their wages in advance. Salt continues to be important enough to feature in the language for many centuries. Other phrases that would have been known to the mediaeval mind were take with a grain of salt, the salt of the earth and below the salt. The ancient roots of 'worth one's salt', and its similarity to the 13th century 'worth one's weight in gold' and the 14th century 'worth one's while' (i.e. worth one's time), give the phrase a historical air. Nevertheless, 'worth one's salt' didn't exist in Roman Latin or even in mediaeval English and dates from as recently as the 19th century. The earliest citation of the phrase that I have found in print is in The African Memoranda, a report of an expedition to Guinea Bissau, by Philip Beaver, 1805:"Hayles has been my most useful man, but of late not worth his salt."It's worth pointing out that, although English is replete with phrases of a nautical origin, none of the above salty phrases has anything to do with the sea.

A piece of the actionMeaningA share in an activity, or in its profits. Origin'A piece of the action' has an unambiguously American flavour. It brings to mind images of gangster movies with Jimmy Cagney and the like demanding 'hey, gimme a pieca da action'. When the Star Trek franchise opted for a mobster themed episode in 1968 they called it 'A Piece of the Action'. It isn't essentially a US phrase though and tracing its genesis takes us well outside the USA and into a history of finance. In the early 1600s, the Dutch came upon an interesting trading innovation - the company. Until then, the spice trade had been profitable but small scale, with spices being brought back from 'the Indies' (broadly what we now call Asia) along the tortuous Spice Road on pack horses. The high price of spices encouraged entrepreneurs to build ships to bring the spices back in larger quantities. There was big money to be made, but the large capital cost of building a fleet and the threat of loss from pirates made it too risky a venture for an individual investor; so, in 1602, they formed a company - the Dutch East India Company. Dutch citizens were invited to invest in the company, which had been given exclusive trading rights to half the world and tax-free status back home. Profits were huge and the clamour to invest was intense. Dirck Bas Jacobsz, one of the company's founders, was instrumental in managing the joint ownership by offering what were then called in Dutch 'acties' or, in English, 'actions'. These were certificates that promised a share in any future profits of the company and what, not unnaturally, came later to be called share certificates. These shares were often purchased by groups rather than individuals. What each of these good citizens had bought was literally 'a piece of the action'. The term 'action', which continued to be used in that context well into the 19th century, was first recorded in English in John Evelyn's Diary, published between 1641 and 1706:"African Actions fell to £30, and the India to £80."'A piece of the action' is certainly a 20th century American phrase. Despite its 1930s mobster overtones, the first use of it that I can find is in the 1957 film Monkey on My Back:"You want a piece of my action, Sam?" The 'action' in the phrase means 'a share in an activity; an opportunity'. It is doubtful that whoever coined it in 1950s America knew the history of the Dutch East Indies Company but, knowingly or not, it was the Dutch 'acties' that were the source of that meaning of 'action'.

Harbinger of doomMeaningA sign, warning of bad things to come.OriginWe now use 'harbinger' in a metaphorical sense, meaning 'forerunner; announcer'. With that meaning, almost anything can be harbingered (the word has been used as a verb as well as a noun since the 17th century, although that usage is now rare). We sometimes hear of 'harbingers of Spring', or 'harbingers of day', but it is the 'harbingers of doom' that are by far the busiest in our present-day language. The original meaning of harbinger was quite specific and had nothing to do with any of the above. In the 12th century, a harbinger was a lodging-house keeper. The word derives from 'harbourer' or, as they spelled it then, 'herberer' or 'herberger' , i.e. one who harbours people for the night. 'Herberer' derives from the French word for 'inn' - 'auberge'. 'Ye herbergers' are referred to (as common lodging-house keepers) in the Old English text The Lambeth Homilies, circa 1175.By the 13th century, 'harbinger' had migrated from its original meaning of lodging keeper, to refer to a scout who went ahead of a military force or royal court to book lodgings for the oncoming hoard. This is the source of the 'advance messenger' meaning that we understand now. Geoffrey Chaucer was the first to record this meaning of 'harbinger', in The Man of Law's Tale, circa 1386: The fame anon thurgh toun is bornHow Alla kyng shal comen on pilgrymage,By herbergeours that wenten hym biforn[The news through all the town was carried,How King Alla would come on pilgrimage,By harbingers that went before him]It was some centuries until the figurative usage, when people began to speak of the harbinger of things other than approaching royalty or house guests. The first usage was of our old friend 'doom', or as the Edinburgh Advertiser had it in September 1772, 'ruin':"The spirit of migration [from Scotland] is the infant harbinger of devoted ruin." It is rather appropriate to find that early usage coming from Scotland. The character of Private Frazer, in Dad's Army, a well-known (in the UK at least) BBC television series, was based on the perceived gloomy attitude of his race. John Laurie, who played the lugubrious Frazer, was the archetypal stage Scotsman and the show's line "We're all doomed, doomed I tell ye" became something of a catchphrase for him. Those pessimistic harbingers of doom who first decided that 'the end of the world is nigh' lived in the 19th century. The earliest printed example of that phrase that I have found is from James Emerson Tennent's Letters from the Aegean, 1829:"Achmet, our janissary, calculating from the decay of their empire and the daily fulfilment of the predictions of Mahomet with regard to the final resurrection, have come to a conclusion that the end of the world is nigh at hand."

Make no bones aboutMeaningTo state a fact in a way that allows no doubt. To have no objection to.OriginThis is another of those ancient phrases that we accept with our mother's milk as an idiom but which seem quite strange when we later give it some thought. When we are trying to convey that we acknowledge or have no objection to something, why bring bones into it?It has been suggested that the bones were dice, which were previously made from bone and are still called bones in gambling circles. That explanation doesn't stand up to scrutiny - 'to make no dice about it' makes little sense. Also, in a 1542 translation of Erasmus's Paraphrase of Luke he discussed the command given to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and wrote that 'he made no bones about it but went to offer up his son.' Erasmus wasn't noted for his visits to the gaming tables and would hardly have used betting terminology to discuss a biblical text.The actual source of this phrase is closer to home and hearth. In 15th century England, if someone wanted to express their dissatisfaction with something, they didn't 'make bones about it', they used the original form of the phrase and 'found bones in it'. This is a reference to the unwelcome discovery of bones in soup - bones = bad, no bones = good. If you found 'no bones' in your meal you were able to swallow it without any difficulty or objection. The earliest citation of the phrase in print comes from the Paston Letters, which include a collection of texts from 1459 relating to a dispute between Paston and the family of the Norfolk soldier Sir John Fastolf (Fastolf was, incidentally, the source of the character Sir John Falstaff in Shakespeare's Henry IV). In the Paston Letters, the context of which is that the litigants are finally accepting a verdict with no objection, Paston includes the line:"And fond that tyme no bonys in the matere." [and found that time no bones in the matter]'Making bones' is usually expressed in the negative. There are rare occurrences of people being described as 'making bones' about this or that, and an early example comes from Richard Simpson's The School of Shakspere, 1878:"Elizabeth was thus making huge bones of sending some £7000 over for the general purposes of the government in Ireland."'Make no bones about it' is now rather archaic and heard less often than before. It did return briefly during the 1980s, as an example of the 'waiter, I'll have a crocodile sandwich, and make it snappy' form of joke. 'Waiter, I'll have tomato soup and make no bones about it' linked neatly back to the phrase's culinary origin.

Double crossMeaningAn act of treachery, perpetrated on a previous partner in a deceit.OriginThe term 'double-cross' has been used in various contexts for many centuries, usually as a straightforward reference to the shape of two crosses, as in the architectural design of cathedrals for example. That meaning is unrelated to the current figurative 'cheating' usage of 'double cross', which dates only from the late 18th century. To find the origin of the expression 'double cross' as it is now used, we need to look first at one of the many meanings of the noun 'cross'. From the mid 1700s, a 'cross' was a transaction that wasn't 'square', i.e. not honest and fair. The term was most often used in a sporting context, where a cross was a match that was lost as a result of a corrupt collusory arrangement between the principals involved. You might expect that a 'double cross' was a deceit in which two parties collude in a swindle and one of them later goes back on the arrangement, crossing both the original punters and his erstwhile partner in crime. Although that is the case, the term 'double' doesn't here mean simply 'two times'. 'To double' had long been used to mean 'to make evasive turns or shifts; to act deceitfully'. This derives from the imagery of someone doubling back over a previous route. This 'doubling' gave rise to the term 'double dealing', which has been used since the early 1500s to refer to someone duplicitously saying one thing and doing another, for example, a 'double agent'.Given that, by the mid 1700s, the language included both 'cross' and 'double', it wasn't a great leap to introduce the term 'double cross' to refer to aggravated duplicity. Double crossing dealings are the precise opposite of those that are 'fair and square', but the two expressions do have one thing in common - they are both tautological. 'Fair' and 'square' both mean honest and 'double' and 'cross' both mean dishonest. The earliest reference that I have found to 'double cross' in print is in David Garrick's 1768 farce The Irish Widow. The play centres around various practical jokes, and the phrase occurs as a play on words between two of the meanings of cross - 'marriage' and 'swindle':Sir Patrick O'Neale: I wish you had a dare swate crater [dear sweet creature] of a daughter like mine, that we might make a double cross of it.Mr. Whittle: (aside) That would be a double cross, indeed!The sporting usage was defined a few years later, in an early self-help tome, written by 'Two Citizens of the World' and 'Containing Hints to the Unwary to Avoid the Stratagems of Swindlers, Cyprians and Lawyers', i.e. How To Live In London, 1828: "A double cross, is where a boxer receives money to lose, and afterwards goes in and beats his man."A systematic policy of double crossing was given the UK government's official, if covert, sanction during the WWII. In 1941, MI5 set up a military counter espionage unit called The Twenty Committee, chaired by John Masterman. The naming of this unit clearly linked the double crosses of the Roman numerals for twenty (XX) with one of the unit's aims, which was to 'double cross' Germany by coercing German spies to become English double agents. The coercion was less than subtle; captured German agents were given an offer they couldn't refuse, i.e. feed false information back to Germany or be shot. During the Cold War, following the publishing of Masterman's The Double-Cross System in the War of 1939-1945, in 1972, the terms 'double cross' and 'double agent' became much more commonplace.

Without let or hindranceMeaningWithout impediment.Origin'Let or hindrance' is usually used in the form 'without let or hindrance', denoting something that is free to progress. 'Without' is just a straightforward indication of a negative and isn't an example of the confusing alternative 'outside' meaning of without, as in 'without a city wall'. 'Hindrance' is also straigthforward and only has one meaning. 'Let' is the word in this phrase that causes confusion. What is a 'let' exactly?When we talk about 'letting something happen', we are using the verb 'to let' in its most common contemporary form, meaning 'to allow'. This has been a common usage since the 10th century. Curiously, let has also been used since the 9th century to mean the exact opposite, i.e. 'to hinder or stand in the way of'. It is the second of these forms that is used in 'let or hindrance'. During the 12th century, the verb was reworked into a noun and obstacles began to be called lets. That version of the word has stayed with us in the language, notably in the game of tennis, where it denotes an obstruction that is specified in the rules and prompts a point to be replayed. Such replayed points are usually the result of the ball clipping the net during a service, but a let may be any interruption to play. Streakers, who are now almost as much of a tradition at the Wimbledon tennis championships as are strawberries and cream, are taken away to the sound of the umpire gravely announcing "play a let". Tennis is replete with obscure terms. Deuce refers to the situation where there are two points required to win a game, i.e. an Anglicized version of the French 'à deux de jeu'. The origin of the term 'love' and the reason why the scores progress irregularly from 15 to 30, to 40, to game, aren't known. The suggestion that 'love' is a variant of the French 'l'oeuf', relating a zero to the ovoid shape of an egg, has no basis in fact. Another similarly ancient sporting term for an obstacle is a 'rub', as in 'the rub of the green', so beloved of snooker commentators. A rub is more specific than a let, in that it refers to a lump on the playing surface. (See 'rub of the green' for more details on this). The expression 'let or hinder' dates from the 16th century and is mentioned in John Baret's A Triple Dictionary, in English, Latin, and French, 1574. In the following years it began to be used in legal proceedings, with specific reference to people who hampered the police in their duties. Samuel Freeman makes a reference to such rascals in The Town Officer, 1799:"Persons who wilfully let or hinder any sheriff or constable."The officers who in 1974 tackled Michael O'Brien, the first known streaker at a major sporting event, might have been surprised to have been told that, in the old linguistic sense at least, they were letting him get away with it.

Dressed to the ninesMeaningDressed flamboyantly or smartly.OriginNine is the most troublesome number in etymology. There are several phrases of uncertain parentage that include the word. Examples are, cloud nine, nine days' wonder and the infamous whole nine yards. We can add 'dressed to the nines' to that list.The most frequently heard attempts to explain the phrase's derivation involve associating the number nine with clothing in some way. One theory has it that tailors used nine yards of material to make a suit (or, according to some authors, a shirt). The more material you had the more kudos you accrued, although nine yards seems generous even for a fop. Another commonly repeated explanation comes from the exquisitely smart uniforms of the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot, which was raised in 1824. The problem with these explanations is that they come with no evidence to support them, apart from a reference to the number nine (or 99, which seems to be stretching the cloth rather thinly). The regiment was in business in the early 19th century, which is at least the right sort of date for a phrase that became widely used in the middle of that century.The first example of the use of the phrase that I can find in print is in Samuel Fallows' The Progressive Dictionary of the English Language, 1835. In his entry for the phrase 'to the nines' Fallows gives the example 'dressed up to the nines' and suggests that it "may perhaps" be derived from 'to thine eynes' - to the eyes. Not bad as a hypothesis, but without any evidence (and I can find none) 'may perhaps' is as far as we can go with that.What counts against the above explanations is the prior use of the shorter phrase 'to the nine' or 'to the nines', which was used to indicate perfection, the highest standards. That was in use in the 18th century, well before 'dressed to the nines' was first used, as in this example from William Hamilton's Epistle to Ramsay, 1719:The bonny Lines therein thou sent me,How to the nines they did content me.It is worth noting that the number nine has long been used as a superlative. The Nine Worthies were characters drawn from the Pagan and Jewish history and from the Bible. The Nine Worthies, usually called simply The Nine, were well-known to mediaeval scholars as the personification of all that was noble and heroic. The Poetick Miscellenies of Mr John Rawlett, 1687, provides the earliest reference to 'to the Nine' that I can find:And Poets most who still make their addressIn private to the Nine.It is clear that 'the Nine' that Rawlett was referring to were the Nine Worthies. It is just as clear that 'dressed to the nines' is merely an extension of 'to the nine/s' and that we could equally well 'dance to the nines' or 'philosophize to the nines'. The search for the link between 'nines' and dress sense has unearthed no convincing candidates. Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but I'll stick my neck out here and say, with this phrase and with the other 'nines' phrases, 'nine' doesn't refer to anything specific - it just means 'a lot'.

Beat around the bushMeaningPrevaricate and avoid coming to the point.OriginThe figurative meaning of the odd phrase 'beat around the bush' or, as it is usually expressed in the UK, 'beat about the bush', evolved from the earlier literal meaning. In bird hunts, some of the participants roused the birds by beating the bushes and enabling others, to use a much later phrase, to 'cut to the chase' and catch the quarry in nets. So, 'beating about the bush' was the preamble to the main event, which was the capturing of the birds. Of course, grouse hunting and other forms of hunt still use beaters today.The phrase is old and first appears in the mediaeval poem Generydes - A Romance in Seven-line Stanzas, circa 1440:Butt as it hath be sayde full long agoo,Some bete the bussh and some the byrdes take.The poem is anonymous and only exists as a single handwritten manuscript in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, the early printed versions all having disappeared. Even at that early date the author's implication was clearly that 'beting the bussh' was considered a poor substitute for getting on with it and 'taking the byydes'. If it really was said 'full long agoo' in the 15th century then the English 'beat about the bush' must be one of the oldest non-biblical phrases in the language. The earliest version that I can find that adds 'about' to 'beat the bush' is in George Gascoigne's Works, 1572:He bet about the bush, whyles other caught the birds.As far as the relative global popularity of the two versions of the phrase goes, the US version is becoming the standard. According to this graph of instances of the two phrases in print, 'beat around the bush' overtook 'beat about the bush' around (or about, if you prefer) 1980.

Hard-heartedMeaningLacking mercy; incapable of pity.OriginThe first mention in print in English of the term 'hard-hearted' is in Geoffrey Chaucer's 1374 translation of Consolation of Philosophy, the 6th century treatise by the Roman philosopher Anicius Boethius:Ne no tere ne wette his face, but he was so hard-herted.The term reflects the mediaeval belief that the heart was the organ that controlled one's thoughts and feelings - there being no understanding of the functioning of the brain at that time. The belief was that the condition of the heart reflected the senses in a direct and literal way. We have retained several mediaeval expressions that we now see as entirely figurative but which were previously akin to a medical diagnosis:- Cold-hearted- Light-hearted - Broken-hearted- Half-hearted - Hard-hearted- Faint-hearted - Whole-hearted The last on that list, whole-hearted, is atypical in that it is a 19th century term and derives from a different meaning of 'hearted', i.e. 'courageous;spirited'.The transition from literal to figurative meaning is matched by the transition in the spelling of the terms. Initially, the two words were usually written separately, then later as a hyphenated pair and finally as a single word. Someone with a 'light heart' was initially 'light hearted', later 'light-hearted' and more recently 'lighthearted' - for example:John Palsgrave's dictionary Lesclarcissement de la Langue Francoyse, 1530: "Lyght herted or mery, alaigre."William Cowper's poem The Task, 1785: "He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch, Cold and yet cheerful."Wilkie Collins's novel Queen of Hearts, 1859: "Mrs. Knifton began to make jokes about it, in her lighthearted way."The 15th century literal way of thinking (and spelling) was resurrected in the 1920s in the popular Tin-Pan Alley song Hard Hearted Hannah:They call her Hard Hearted Hannah, The vamp of Savannah, The meanest gal in town; Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher, She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!Of course, to be 'hearted' these days we just need a T-shirt. The 'I heart NY' message began being used in the USA in the 1980s and, in January 2011, the OED defined a new meaning of the verb heart as "To love; to be fond of: - originally with reference to logos using the symbol of a heart to denote the verb 'love'", which is as close as we can get to an acceptance that the symbol is now part of the language.See also: the meaning and origin of 'half-hearted'.

Eeny, meeny, miny, moMeaningThe first line of a popular children's counting rhyme.OriginOf all of the phrases and idioms in the English language 'eeny, meenie, miny, mo' must be the one with the widest variety of spellings. I've opted for 'Eeny, meeny, miny, mo' but there are many others - 'Eenie, meenie, miney, moe', 'Eany, meany, miney, mo' and so on. Added to that, as far back as the 19th century there have been variants of the rhyme which are so dissimilar to our current version as to be scarcely recognisable - 'Hana, mana, mona, mike' (from New York) and 'Eetern, feetern, peeny, pump' (from Scotland) and many of these now have local variants and words added from other languages.What lies behind this variability is that throughout the 19th century the rhyme spread from different parts of the UK to every playground in the English-speaking world, but by word of mouth rather than on paper. There never was an accepted definitive version, so the children who used the rhyme were very happy to substitute their own words as the mood took them.As adults, we might be curious as to whether the words mean anything and what their origin might have been. Children appear to have no such concerns. An example comes from the Danish region near Kattegat, where a rhyme arrived during the British occupation in the Napoleonic wars:Jeck og JillVent op de hillOg Jell kom tombling efter...which makes as little sense in Danish as it does in English but, despite it being entirely meaningless to them, the children of the area still sing it.The best known version of the rhyme is the one that is now widely derided as insulting, especially in the USA, where the middle two lines originated:Eena, meena, mina, mo,Catch a ****** by the toe, If he hollers, let him go,Eena meena, mina, mo.[Note: the ****** replaces the 'n-word' which tends to be blocked by many email services]A more acceptable version has now established itself:Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,Catch the tiger/monkey/baby by the toe.If it hollers[USA]/screams[UK] let him go,Eeny, meeny, miny, mo.The rhyme is used by groups of children as a way of selecting someone to take a role that is different from the others. As difference is unwelcome to children, the formula had to be sufficiently unpredictable to be accepted as fair. A leader takes the counting role and, in the rhythm of the rhyme, points to each child in turn. The last line is often topped off with a short emphasized 'You are It!' or 'O, U, T spells out!', which all the children join in with. Sometimes the child pointed to at the end of one count is the one selected - to be 'It' in a game of hide and seek, for example. In more important choices - selecting who has to ask that grumpy man down the road for their ball back - the one pointed to last drops out and the formula is repeated several times until only one is left.[Note: UK residents who have voted in today's referendum might notice a parallel with the 'First Past the Post' and 'Alternative Vote' systems.]'Eeny, meeny, miny, mo' is certainly a strange line, so does it mean anything and does curiosity about its origin lead us anywhere? Well, as is so often the case in etymology, yes and no. There is a similarity between the words of the phrase and some of the numerals in pre-English Celtic and Cumbrian languages. For example, the oral tradition of the English coastal town of Yarmouth voices 'one, two, three, four' as 'ina, mina, tethera, methera'. Also, the word for 'one' in Welsh, Cornish, Irish and Breton is, respectively, 'un' (pronounced 'een'), 'ouyn', 'aon' and 'unan' - all of them sounding not unlike 'een' or 'eeny'.The age of the phrase is uncertain. It first began to be written down in the 19th century - the scholarly journal Notes and Queries published this in the February 1855 edition:"The following are used in the United States for the selection of a tagger...Eeny, meeny, moany, mite,Butter, lather, boney, strike,Hair, bit, frost, neck,Harrico, barrico, we, wo, wack"This bears more than a passing resemblance to the English version recorded by Fred Jago in The Glossary of the Cornish Dialect, 1882:Ena, mena, mona, mite,Bascalora, bora, bite,Hugga, bucca, bau,Eggs, butter, cheese, bread.Stick, stock, stone dead - OUT."There's no doubt that the rhyme is older than the 19th century recorded versions, possibly very much older. The link to the names of numerals in ancient languages is also likely. Many farmers and fishermen on the fringes of Britain used such language for counting until quite recently and many natives of the north of England can still count from one to five in 'the old way' - 'yan, tan tehera, methera, pimp'.Ancient Celtic counting system or Victorian nonsense verse? American in origin or English? Your best bet is to put all the available theories in a circle and repeat this rhyme - Eeny, meeny...

As daft as a brushMeaningVery foolish.OriginOn the face of it, brushes wouldn't seem to be any more daft than anything else. As the source of the expression isn't obvious, various suggestions have been put forward as to what form of brush is being referred to; for instance:- The phrase originated as 'as soft as a brush' and that the brush is the tail of a fox. This is plausible in that 'soft' is a northern English term for stupid and foxes tails are in fact quite soft to the touch.- The brushes in the expression are the boys that were employed in the 18th/19th centuries to climb inside chimneys to sweep them. The theory here, which is somewhat less plausible, is that the boys were made into idiots by being repeatedly dropped on their heads when being lowered down the chimneys.Nevertheless, as we shall see, the 'brush' in this simile is neither of these; it is, as the dictionary would have it "A utensil consisting of a piece of wood or other suitable material, set with small tufts or bunches of bristles, hair, or the like, for sweeping or scrubbing dust and dirt from a surface.", that is - a brush. Are brushes daft? Not particularly, but then again I've never had a sensible conversation with one.When looking for early examples of 'daft as a brush' in print we find that it first starts appearing the 1950s. An example is in William Morgan Williams's The Sociology of an English Village: Gosforth, 1956:The wives of two members of a kin-group locally thought to be eccentric and extremely unsociable were pointed out by several people as 'gay queer' and 'daft as a brush'.[Gosforth is in Cumbria, UK]1956 seems later than I would have expected and, as the word 'daft' has always been used more often in the north of England than in other places, a scan of some north country references seems in order. Voilà. 'Daft as a brush' it is in fact predated by an earlier variant 'daft as a besom'. The earliest citation of that that I can find is a listing in William Dickinson's A glossary of the words and phrases of Cumberland, 1859:Daft, without sense. "Ey, as daft as a besom."A 'besom' is of course a brush made from twigs and a corroboration that the phrase originated with 'besom' rather than 'brush' version comes in another glossary, from just a few years earlier and collected in the same area - John and William Brockett's A glossary of North country words, with their etymology, 1846:Fond, silly, foolish. An old Northern word. 'Fond-as-a-buzzom', remarkably silly.The use of 'fond' to mean foolish predated our current usage, which is 'to be fond of something or someone'. That present day meaning migrated from the earlier word, which in time came to mean 'display a foolish affection for'. In Richard Rolle's Psalter, 1339, the author refers to 'fonnyd maydyns' (foolish girls). The word appears in more contemporary language in John Lyly's Euphues: the Anatomy of Wyt, 1578:He that is young thinketh the old man fond.So remember, if you are visiting the English northern counties and some old codger says that you are 'as fond as a buzzom', isn't exactly a compliment.

Jack of all tradesMeaningA man who can turn his hand to many things.OriginWith any phrase that includes a name, it's natural to consider whether its the name of a real person. In this case, as was the case with many other literary Jacks - Jack the Lad, Jack Robinson, Jack Sprat, Jack Horner, Jack Frost, etc, Jack of all trades was a generic term rather than a living and breathing individual. In fact, the very long list of terms that include 'Jack' exceeds that of any other name in English and this reflects the fact that, as a derivative of the common name 'John', 'Jack' has been used just to mean 'the common man'. This usage dates back to the 14th century and an example is found in John Gower's Middle English poem Confessio Amantis, 1390:Therwhile he hath his fulle packe, They seie, 'A good felawe is Jacke'.We now use 'Jack of all trades, master of none' in a derogatory way. Originally, this wasn't the case and the label 'Jack of all trades' carried no negative connotation, the 'master of none' part being added later. Nevertheless, mediaeval Jacks were pretty much at the bottom of the social tree. The OED defines the generic meaning of the name Jack thusly:Jack - A man of the common people; a lad, fellow, chap; especially a low-bred or ill-mannered fellow, a 'knave'If 16th century commentators wanted to imply that a person was stretching their talents too thinly they resorted to the disparaging Latin term Johannes factotum ('Johnny do-it-all'). In 1592, the English writer and member of the literary establishment Robert Greene wrote a pamphlet entitled Groats-worth of Witte. In that he ventured the opinion that a new writer on the scene was:An upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blanke verse as the best of you. Beeing an absolute Johannes fac totum, is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey.Sadly for Greene's ongoing reputation the 'Upstart crow' was William Shakespeare.Various trades were populated by Jacks - lumberjacks, steeplejacks for example, and sailors were Jack-tars.For no especial reason, I've included a picture of three of my uncles who were steeplejacks. For the record, none of them was a Jack outside of work; they were Gilbert, Frank and Verdon.The name Jack was also added to many utilitarian objects which in some way took the place of a lad or man, for example:Smoke-jack (a roasting spit)Jack-plane (a basic carpenter's plane)Jack-screw (a lifting winch)Jack-frame (a carpenter's sawing horse)Boot-jack (for pulling off boots)Jack-engine (a miner's winch)Jack-file (a coarse file)There can't have been any trades in the Middle Ages that didn't make use of a jack of some sort. 'Jack of all trades' entered the language in 1612 when Geffray Minshull wrote of his experiences in prison in Essayes and characters of a prison and prisoners:Some broken Cittizen, who hath plaid Jack of all trades.The 'master of none' addition began to be added in the late 18th century. The headmaster of Charterhouse School, Martin Clifford, in a collection of notes on the poems of Dryden, circa 1677 wrote:Your Writings are like a Jack of all Trades Shop, they have Variety, but nothing of value.In 1770, the Gentleman's Magazine offered the opinion that "Jack at all trades, is seldom good at any."The earliest example that I can find in print of the actual phrase 'Jack of all trades, master of none' is in Charles Lucas's Pharmacomastix, 1785:The very Druggist, who in all other nations in Europe is but Pharmacopola, a mere drug-merchant, is with us, not only a physician and chirurgeon, but also a Galenic and Chemic apothecary; a seller of druggs, medicines, vertices, oils, paints or colours poysons, &c. a Jack of all trades, and in truth, master of none.Maybe taking on 'all trades' wasn't wise but Jacks were often master craftsmen in their chosen trade. History books tell us that Cardinal Wolsey built Hampton Court Palace and that Charles Barry built the Houses of Parliament - don't believe it, it was Jack.

Man's best friendMeaningAn animal that performs valuable service to humans, often with reference to dogs.Origin'A dog is a man's best friend'? Well, if popularity is anything to go by, perhaps that's true; according to the American Kennel Club, there are more pet dogs in the USA than there are people in Britain. However, the affection that dogs are held in by many these days is a fairly recent development. How we used to think about dogs can be judged by looking at how they have been portrayed in language over the centuries.The first linguistic oddity to do with dogs is the where the word 'dog' came from. The name was preceded by the perfectly good Anglo-Saxon word 'hound', which was also used in other European languages. 'Dog', in common with several other animal names ending in 'g', like frog, hog, pig and stag, seems to have been coined around the 13th century for reasons that no one is at all sure about.Prior to the 18th century, dogs were kept for hunting and defence and not as pets. The only deviation from that rule was that of the derided 'lap-dog', which John Evelyn recorded in his Diary, circa 1684, as a dog fit only for ladies:Those Lap-dogs had so in delicijs [delight] by the Ladies - are a pigmie sort of Spaniels.Lap-dogs apart, the phrases used to refer to dogs in the 16th and 17th centuries indicate their image as vicious and disease-ridden:Hair of the dog that bit you, first used in 1546 as a reference to rabiesCast someone to the dogs, 1556 Dog in the manger , 1564If you lie down with dogs, you will get up with fleas, 1573The dogs of war, 1601Go to the dogs, 1619Also, phrases that indicate the treatment of dogs show that they were considered to be of little worth:Lead a dog's life (1528), Not fit for a dog (1625), As sick as a dog (1705),The unfortunate mutts were considered so beyond the pale that dog hangings, as punishment for chasing sheep or whatever else dogs did naturally, were commonplace. The phrase 'give a dog a bad name', 1705, was originally 'give a dog a bad name and hang him'.The language relating to canines took a turn for the better later in the 18th century. The first example in print of the term 'dog-basket' dates from 1768. The need for a name for a piece of furniture provided specifically for the comfort of dogs shows a clear turning point in attitudes towards them. This shift in outlook continued steadily and in 1823 we first find 'dog biscuits', followed in 1852 by 'dog show'. By the mid 20th century we find clear linguistic evidence that a dog was to be considered almost on a par with humanity - 'dog-sitter' (1942).The greatest claim to fame of Warrensburg, Missouri is that it is where the phrase 'a dog is a man's best friend' originated. In 1870, a farmer shot a neighbour's dog and, in the subsequent court case where the owner sued for damages, the lawyer George Graham Vest gave a tear-jerking speech that became known as the Eulogy to a Dog:"Gentlemen of the jury, a man's dog stands by him in prosperity and poverty, in health and sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow, and the snow drives fiercely, if only he can be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer; he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens." - And so on...A statue of Old Drum, as the deceased beast was called, stands outside the town's courtroom. Sadly for the Warrensburg Tourist Board, the Senator Vest didn't originate the phrase, but he may have read it in a US newspaper, as it appeared in print fifty years earlier in The New-York Literary Journal, Volume 4, 1821:The faithful dog - why should I strive To speak his merits, while they live In every breast, and man's best friend Does often at his heels attend.To paraphrase Harold Macmillan - 'Fido, you've never had it so good'.

Rest on one's laurelsMeaningTo be satisfied with one's past success and to consider further effort unnecessary.OriginThe laurels that are being referred to when someone is said to 'rest on his laurels' are the aromatically scented Laurus Nobilis trees or, more specifically, their leaves. The trees are known colloquially as Sweet Bay and are commonly grown as culinary or ornamental plants.The origins of the phrase lie in ancient Greece, where laurel wreaths were symbols of victory and status. Of course, ancient Greece is where history and mythology were frequently mixed, so we need to tread carefully. The pre-Christian Greeks associated their god Apollo with laurel - that much is historical fact, as this image of Apollo wearing a laurel wreath on a 2nd century BC coin indicates. The reason for that association takes us into the myth of Apollo's love for the nymph Daphne, who turned into a Bay tree just as Apollo approached her (anything could happen if you were a Greek god). Undeterred, Apollo embraced the tree, cut off a branch to wear as a wreath and declared the plant sacred. Their belief in the myth caused the Greeks to present laurel wreaths to winners in the Pythian Games, which were held at Delphi in honour of Apollo every four years from the 6th century BC.Following the decline of the Greek Empire, the use of wreaths of laurel as emblems of victory seems to have taken a long holiday and didn't re-emerge until the Middle Ages. Geoffrey Chaucer referred to laurels in that context in The Knight's Tale, circa 1385:With laurer corouned as a conquerourAnd there he lyueth in ioye and in honour .[With laurel crowned as conqueror There he lived in joy and honour]A 'laureate' was originally a person crowned with a laurel wreath. We continue to call those who are especially honoured laureates although the laurel leaves are usually kept for the kitchen these days. Nevertheless, laureates benefit in other ways; Nobel Laureates get a nice medal and 10 million Swedish Krona and Poets Laureate (in the UK at least) get a useful salary and a butt of sack (barrel of sherry).As to the phrase's meaning, to 'rest on one's laurels' isn't considered at all a praiseworthy strategy - it suggests a decline into laziness and lack of application. That's not the original meaning. When 'rest on one's laurels' or, as it was initially, 'repose on one's laurels' was coined it was invariably part of a valedictory speech for some old soldier or retiring official. An early example of that usage is found inThe Memoirs of the Cardinal de Retz, 1723:The Duke [of Orleans] was old enough to take his Repose under the Shadow of his Laurels.Of course, the 'repose' was figurative - no one was imagining someone sleeping on a bed of laurel leaves, although the citation above could be construed as referring to laurel trees rather than laurel wreaths. No such doubts with a slightly later citation from the London-based Gentleman's Magazine, 1733, on the retirement of a schoolmaster of Westminster School:So thou, paternal Sage, may'st now repose. Nor seek new Laurels to adorn thy Brows.As soon as we move into the energetic Victorian era, the meaning changes and the phrase is used with a distinctly disapproving tone. Victoria had barely gained the throne when we find this piece in the review magazine The Literary Chronicle, 1825, which praises the work of Maria Edgeworth:We do not affect to wish she should repose on her laurels and rest satisfied; on the contrary, we believe that genius is inexhaustible... For Miss Edgeworth there must be no rest on this side the grave.Tough audience the Victorians. We are hardly any more charitable these days. 'One-hit wonders' are sneered at and, with proper Anglo-Saxon earnestness, Anthony Burgess dismissed his fellow author Joseph Heller's inability to write a second book for 13 years following the success of Catch-22 by sniping that "Heller suffers from that fashionable American disease, writer's block".

Purple patchMeaningAn overly elaborate or effusive piece of writing. Also, a period of notable success or good luck.Origin'Purple patches', which are also sometimes called 'purple passages' or 'purple prose', were originally a figurative reference to florid literary passages, added to a text for dramatic effect. They were the literary equivalent of adding a patch of purple material to an otherwise undecorated garment. Purple was chosen because, as well as being a distinctive colour, it was the colour reserved for emperors and other distinguished statesmen in imperial Rome. Most of the early references to 'purple patches' contain clear evidence of classical origins, many of them including Latin text.The first person I can identify as having used 'purple patch' in print in English was no less an author than Elizabeth I. In 1598, Queen Elizabeth translated Horace's Latin textDe Arte Poetica and this was published in 1899 as part of Queen Elizabeth's Englishings:Oft to beginnings graue and shewes of great is sowed A purple pace, one or more for vewe.[Note: 'Purple pace' was the translation of the original 'purpureus pannus'. 'Pace' meant 'passage'.]Many works of art and scholarship that are listed as the creation of various English monarchs weren't actually their own work, the attributions being merely a form of flattery. However, Elizabeth benefited from the Tudor notion that aristocratic women were suitable recipients of formal education and her mother, Anne Boleyn, made sure that "she wolde endewe her with the knowlege of all tounges, as Hebrue, Greeke, Latyne, Italian, Spanishe, Frenche". The queen became a noted Latin scholar and we can be assured that the translation (and wouldn't it be nice if we still used the Tudor word 'Englishing' for translations into English?) was by her own hand.The term 'purple patch' wasn't much used again until the 18th century, at which time literary critics valued evenness of pace and style in literary works. Unevenly written texts were singled out for censure and 'purple patch' was the ideal label for a passage that stood out as overly florid. This idea was expressed forcibly in the 1704 book of literary criticism The True Tom Double:All a Man writes should be proportion'd Even and of a piece; and one Part of the Work should not so far out-shine, as to Obscure and Darken the Other. The Purple Patches he claps upon his Course Style, make it seem much Courser than it is.It wasn't until the 20th century that 'purple patches' were used in relation to anything other than writing. The term then came to mean 'a period of good fortune or creativity'. An early example is cited in the newspaper The Westminster Budget, October 1900:True, it is hardly to be counted a purple patch of history, but a man must surely blame himself if he does not find something epic in the struggle. [of the common people]Purple patches took a turn back from the figurative to the literal in the 1960s when hippies took to wearing purple velvet and patching jeans with it. 'Hendrix purple' is now a recognised shade of dye in the fashion industry.

Up the poleMeaningVarious meanings.Origin'Up the pole' is an odd phrase, or rather, it is an odd collection of phrases, in that it has numerous meanings. These meanings have little to do with each other and, for the most part, little to do with poles. What is difficult to explain is how and why several different meanings for the same expression were all coined in the UK just a few years apart. Of course, poles are commonplace objects and instances of the expression 'up the pole' have abounded in print for centuries - bears/beans/monkeys climbing 'up the pole', people lifting/digging/staring 'up the pole' etc. Perhaps now would be a good time to list the various figurative meanings, in date order of their coinage:In favour or good repute; strait-laced - A. Barrère & C. G. Leland Dictionary of Slang, 1890:"Pole, up the, thought well of by your superiors. Also applied to strict, strait-laced people, who are or like to be considered goody-goody".These two slang meanings, which are of military origin, appear to be the first coinage of 'up the pole'. Given that source, the pole may have been a flagpole, but the citation above doesn't make that clear.In confusion or error - The Daily News, April 1896:"She remonstrated with the latter, and told him he was 'up a pole' - i.e. in the wrong".In trouble or difficulty - A. R. Marshall's Pomes from Pink 'Un, 1897:"He heard himself alluded to as being 'up the pole'".[Note: This book was a popular collection of poems. The Pink 'Un was a newspaper printed on pink paper - either the Sporting Times or the Financial Times.]Drunk - Daily Telegraph, December 1897:Plaintiff: but your little girl was frequently saying that you were 'up the poll'. Judge: Up the what? The High Bailiff explained that the term was a slang one for being intoxicated.This meaning is antiquated and now rarely used.Crazy; at one's wits' end - Westmoreland Gazette, March 1904:"Plaintiff's definition of the phrase 'up the pole' differed from that of her cousin who said it meant being drunk. Mrs. Frasier said that it meant being crazy".This version appears to have travelled from the UK to Australia and New Zealand, where it is still commonly used. In a classic example of folk etymology, 'up the pole' has been suggested to be named after De La Pole Psychiatric Hospital, Hull, UK - after the fashion of 'doolally' being taken from Deolali sanatorium, India. Inmates who were sent there were supposed to have been sent 'up De La Pole'. Inventive guess, but De La Pole Hospital was so named in 1936.Pregnant - James Joyce Ulysses, 1918:"That red Carlisle girl? Is she up the pole? Better ask Seymour that".As befits such a celebrated book as Ulysses, this is the version of the phrase that most people know. It is also the only one that appears to refer directly to any sort of pole - the alternate version of this 'pregnant' meaning are 'up the stick' and 'up the spout' leaving little doubt about what 'pole' was being referred to. All the early usages of this meaning in print come from the pens of Dublin based authors, so an Irish origin seems highly likely.The only thing tying the versions of the phrase together is that they (apart from the first) relate to some degree of difficulty. It may be that the people coining meanings for this expression were alluding to the apparent difficulty of being stuck at the top of a real pole - but we aren't ever likely to confirm that. There was a fad for 'pole-sitting' in the early 20th century, in which participants were certainly 'up the pole' and could be said to be in some difficulty, but that comes too late for it to have been the source of this phrase.

Turn of phraseMeaningA distinctive spoken or written expression.Origin'Turn of phrase' is a commonplace but rather odd expression - in what sense can a phrase be 'turned'? Ladies are, or at least used to be, sometimes described as having 'well-turned' legs/thighs/ankles, but that derives from an allusion to the symmetry and precision of wood turning, which hardly seems appropriate for an abstract entity like a phrase.What is a phrase anyway? Well, there's no exact definition and so it depends on who you ask. Had you been around in 1530 when the word 'phrase' was coined, you would have been wise not to have asked the language scholar John Palsgrave. It was he who first the word into print but, confusingly, gave two differing examples of its meaning. Palsgrave's aim was to help Englishmen to learn to speak French and to that end he published Lesclarcissement de la Langue Francoyse, the first grammar of the French language.Palsgrave illustrated the meaning of the word 'phrase' by giving examples of phrases in English with their French equivalents."Whan all is doone and sayd, pour tout potaige - a phrasis."In that illustration he was using the meaning of the word as we now understand it, that is, 'a small group or collocation of words expressing a single notion; a common or idiomatic expression'. That 'collection of words' definition of 'phrase' is hardly unambiguous and could just as well be used for 'idiom', 'saying' or 'expression'. There are also many other linguistic terms that, while they have specialised uses, can all lay claim to being phrases - 'proverbs', 'adages', 'maxims', 'clichés' and so on. Added to that, Palsgrave gave us an entirely different definition of what Tudor gentry understood by the word 'phrase', that is, not words at all but a 'manner or style of speech or writing'. In the same French/English grammar he remarked on "The differences of phrasys betwene our tong and the frenche tong". He went on to explain "The phrasys of our tong and theyrs differeth". By that he meant, not that the English and French use different expressions (which even the most untutored student would surely have known) but that the French have a different manner and style of speaking to the English.That 'style of speaking or writing' meaning gives us a lead in explaining how a phrase can be said to be 'turned'. Before the advent of printing the beauty of written texts was judged not only on their content but also on the quality of the writer's calligraphy - much as Japanese Haiku is appreciated today. The word 'style' derives from the tool used for writing, the stylus, and to the mediaeval mind writing style was as much about the craft of calligraphy as it was about the ideas conveyed in the text. An early handwritten example of Chaucer's Clerk's Tale, circa 1386, used 'style' with that meaning:Therfore Petrak writeth this storie, which with heigh stile he enditeth.So, a phrase was a style of speaking or writing, and style meant beauty of expression. We can now interpret a fine 'turn of phrase' as analogous to a skilfully-crafted piece of wood turned on a lathe. John Dryden referred to the 'turning' of words in this sense in The Satires of Decimus Junius Juvenalis, 1693:Had I time, I cou'd enlarge on the Beautiful Turns of Words and Thoughts; which are as requisite in this, as in Heroique Poetry.Benjamin Franklin - first with many things - appears to have been the first to use the precise expression 'turn of phrase' in his Letters, 1779:A new version [of the Bible], in which, preserving the sense, the turn of phrase and manner of expression should be modern.

Bean counter Meaning A disparaging term for an accountant, or anyone who one who is excessively concerned with statistical records or accounts. Origin When researching the expression 'bean counter' there is a difficulty - the term has several different meanings. The common usage these days is as a name for a rather pedantic accountant, the implication being that, while most of us are content to buy beans by the bag, fussy accountants want to know exactly how many they are paying for. Before the first hapless accountant was called a 'bean counter', the phrase was also used as the name of a place where beans were sold, especially in the USA where 'pork and bean counters' were commonplace in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Added to that, our inventive predecessors used machines to count beans - and there's no need to tell you what they called them. This variability can lead to some confusion when scanning old newspaper records and other references. Nevertheless, I'll plough on and try to sort the leguminosae from the chaff. Bean counters, that is, 'counters where beans were sold', came first. The US newspaper the Lewiston Evening Journal referred to these in June 1907: The Clerk, seeing himself worsted by numbers... walked over to the bean counter where he again busied himself putting up packages for the evening trade. This was followed by bean counters, that is, 'machines that count beans', which meaning is cited in the Pennsylvania newspaper The New Castle News, March 1916: City Registry Clerk Stanley Treser has invented a new device. It is known as the bean counter. Then, lastly, we get to bean counters, that is, 'accountants'. The earliest reference that I can find to the use of 'bean counter' with this meaning is in the US newspaper The Fort Wayne News And Sentinel, February 1919, in an article titled The Bean Counter: The son of Josephus has been promoted in the quartermaster's department. "I suppose," remarked the Gentleman at the Adjacent Desk "I suppose that somebody has to count the beans for Colonel Roosevelt's fighting sons." The 'fighting sons' were the US soldiers engaged in the latter part of WWI. The story alludes to the American politician Josephus Daniels who served in the administration of Theodore Roosevelt, who was himself a colonel during his military service and was a strong supporter of the US's involvement in WWI. The phrase appears in Australia soon afterwards, either by migration from the USA or by independent coinage. An example is found in The Parliamentary Debates of the Australian House of Representatives, 1928: It is not a bean counter's bill. There is no attempt to make any savings. This insinuation that 'bean counters' were penny-pinching accountants who could't see the bigger picture chimes in well with the no-nonsense reputation of Australian politicians. The phrase thrived down under during the 1930/40s before becoming commonplace throughout the English-speaking world later in the 20th century. 介个肿么好像许久前读过了？

Fair to middlingMeaningSlightly above average.Origin'Fair to middling' comes to the party with two friends, fair to middlin' and fair to midland. Both of these gatecrashers derive from the original phrase, but in different ways. Fair to middlin' is just a colloquial version written in the way that the expression is often spoken, in mid-west America at least, which, as we will see, is where the expression originated.Fair to midland is an odder fish and comes from the mispronunciation of 'middling' as 'midland'. The question is, why would anyone do that? It could be just a simple mistake, although that seems unlikely as 'fair to midland' doesn't really mean anything. More likely is that it was the result of a deliberate jokey mispronunciation, along the lines of san fairy Ann, taking the Miguel etc. This could have originated in the English Midlands. It is widely used there and the English are inveterate 'accidentally on purpose' mispronouncers - Cockney Rhyming Slang is an entire dialect built along those lines. In the case of 'fair to midland', the origin is more likely to be the USA, specifically Texas, the reference being to that state's city of Midland. The earliest printed citation of 'fair to midland' that I can find comes from The New York Times, May 1935:Dr. William Tweddell, who is what might be called a fair-to-Midland golfer...The current usage of the expression is predominantly American and has been boosted by the popularity of the US hard rock band that has adopted it as its name.As to the original version of the phrase 'fair to middling', that is also of American origin. 'Middling' was and is a term used by farmers to describe the quality of farm produce, especially sheep. There were several loosely defined grades of produce: 'good', 'fair, 'middling', 'ordinary' and 'poor'.'Middling' is an old Scots word and has been in use since at least the 15th century with the same meaning as now, that is, 'of medium or moderate size, strength, quality'. In around 1450, the Marquis of Bute wrote the Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue, which includes what appears to be the earliest example of 'middling' in print:'The ynch sulde be with the thoum off midling mane nother our mikil nor our litil bot be tuyx the twa'.I interpret that Old Scots text as meaning 'The inch should be measured with the thumb near the middle, neither at the largest point nor the smallest but between the two' but, if there are any old Scots out there who know better, I would be happy to be enlightened.'Fair' was used in the UK from the 18th century onward to describe farm produce. An example of that usage is found in John Mortimer's farming handbook The Whole Art of Husbandry, 1707:As you gather your Fruit, separate the fairest and biggest from the middling.These farming terms travelled to America with the early Scottish and English settlers. Like sailors who, when they needed finer designations of direction than North, East South and West, came up with South-west, North-east etc., farmers needed a name for 'not quite fair but better than average' and they opted for 'fair to middling'. The earliest uses of the expression all come from the USA, as does this example from an 1829 edition of John Stuart Skinner's farming journal The American Farmer:Two or three lots of good wethers [castrated rams] brought from $2.50 a 3 per head, and a few lots of fair to middling, $1.50 a 2.Farmers didn't stop there and came up with other intermediate grades, like 'good fair'. Needing finer and finer classifications of quality, they again followed the sailors' lead and copied their 'North-north-east' style. In 1873, Beeton's Dictionary of Commerce described a delivery of cotton as:Good fair to good saw-ginned Surat cotton.

Booby prizeMeaningA prize given to make fun of the loser in a contest or game.OriginA Booby is a type of gannet. 'Boobies' has also been used as a slang term for breasts since around 1935. This booby is neither of those. The word has been used to mean dunce or nincompoop since at least the late 16th century and that's the 'booby' of 'booby prize' and 'booby trap'. The word probably derives from the Spanish word 'bobo' meaning 'fool' or 'dunce'. An example of that usage, as 'bobie', comes in The Pleasant Comodie of Patient Grissill, 1599:Let Gwenthyan see what bobie fool loves her...It is also found, as 'booby', in Fletcher and Massinger's comic play The Custome of the Countrey, circa 1640:Cry you great booby.Some etymological records have it that people were labelled as boobies because they were like the seemingly dim-witted seabirds. Actually, it was the other way about. The blue-footed avians were named boobies by the 17th century sailors who first came across them in the eastern Pacific because they didn't attempt to escape when approached. Thomas Herbert recorded this apparently stupid and 'booby-like' behaviour in the travelogue Relation Travails, 1634:One of the Saylers espying a Bird fitly called a Booby, hee mounted to the top-mast and tooke her. The foolish quality of which Bird is to sit still, not valuing danger.The phrase 'booby prize' originated as a term of disparagement for the person with the lowest score in a contest. It was probably coined in the USA. All the early printed references to 'booby prize' originate from there - the earliest that I can find is from a student newspaper from Oberlin, Ohio, The Oberlin Review, 1881:The gentlemen strove at skill in hemming aprons for the fair ones: the first prize was won by Mr. Jackson, the booby prize by Mr. Jones.

Between a rock and a hard placemeaningIn difficulty, faced with a choice between two unsatisfactory options.OriginThis phrase originated in the USA in the early part of the 20th century. It is the American manifestation of a phrase that exists in several forms in other cultures.The dilemma of being in a position where one is faced with two equally unwelcome options appears to lie deep in the human psyche. Language always reflects people's preoccupations and there are several phrases that express this predicament. The first of these quite literally conveys the uncomfortable nature of the choice between two lemmas (propositions), i.e. 'on the horns of a dilemma'. Other phrases that compare two less than desirable alternatives are 'the lesser of two evils', 'between the devil and the deep blue sea', 'between Scylla and Charybdis', 'an offer you can't refuse' and 'Hobson's choice'.The earliest known printed citation of 'between a rock and a hard place' is in the American Dialect Society's publication Dialect Notes V, 1921:"To be between a rock and a hard place, ...to be bankrupt. Common in Arizona in recent panics; sporadic in California."The 'recent panics' referred to in that citation are undoubtedly the events surrounding the so-called US Bankers' Panic of 1907. This financial crisis was especially damaging to the mining and railroad industries of the western states.In 1917, the lack of funding precipitated by the earlier banking crisis led to a dispute between copper mining companies and mineworkers in Bisbee, Arizona. The workers, some of whom had organized in labour unions, approached the company management with a list of demands for better pay and conditions. These were refused and subsequently many workers at the Bisbee mines were forcibly deported to New Mexico.It's tempting to surmise, given that the mineworkers were faced with a choice between harsh and underpaid work at the rock-face on the one hand and unemployment and poverty on the other, that this is the source of the phrase. The phrase began to be used frequently in US newspapers in the late 1930s, often with the alternative wording 'between a rock and a hard spot'.A more recent example of the use of the expression, and one for which it seems gruesomely apt, is recounted in the 2010 film 127 Hours, which is based on Aron Ralston's book Between a Rock and a Hard Place. The memoir recounts the 127 hours that Ralston spent alone and trapped by a boulder in Robbers Roost, Utah, after a climbing accident in April 2003, eventually opting for the 'hard place' of freeing himself by cutting off part of his right arm.

AbracadabraMeaningAn exclamation used by conjurors when performing a trick.OriginWhen stage conjurors and magicians come to the finale of a trick and exclaim 'Abracadabra!' the implication is that a mysterious power is being summoned to perform the required magic. In our information age, in which it is possible to look up how virtually any stunt is staged, we don't take the claims of magical powers too seriously. That wasn't the case when the word abracadabra was first in common use.Mediaeval folk believed in magic as an everyday fact and any unusual event that they couldn't explain was considered to be the result of some form of enchantment. They used the incantation 'Abracadabra' to ward off such bewitchment and as a remedy for poor health. The word was recited repeatedly, each time with the final letter being removed, until just 'a' remained. It was believed that the strength of the illness diminished as the word became shorter. The charm was also written out on paper and worn in an amulet or sewn into clothing.No one is sure as to the origin of the strange word 'abracadabra'. It is known to have been in use in 4th century Latin but there are several theories that place the derivation before that, including:Roman sages, notably Serenus Sammonicus, coined the word and devised the repeated word formula in the 2nd century AD.It being related to another magical word - 'abraxas'. In the Greek system of alphabetic numerology this word is significant in that it contains letters that add up to 365, the number of days in the year.The word is of Hebrew or Aramaic origin, being derived from the Hebrew words 'ab' (father), 'ben' (son), and 'ruach acadosch' (holy spirit) or the Aramaic for 'demon' respectively.Sadly, none of these theories stands up to close examination and actual documentary evidence is as insubstantial as those fragments of mediaeval paper.A reference in print to the use of the word in English that dates back to 1582 is found in Eva Rimmington Taylor's The Troublesome Voyage of Capt. Edward Fenton:Banester sayth yt he healed 200 in one yer of an ague by hanging abracadabra about their necks.The belief in the power of the word lasted well into the 18th century. In his Journal of the Plague Year, 1722, Daniel Defoe was saddened by the continuing superstition of the populace when faced with the threat of plague:People deceiv'd; and this was in wearing Charms, Philters, Exorcisms,  Amulets, and I know not what Preparations, to fortify the Body with them against the Plague; as if the Plague was but a kind of a Possession of an evil Spirit; and that it was to be kept off with Crossings, Signs of the Zodiac, Papers tied up with so many Knots; and certain Words, or Figures written on them, as particularly the Word Abracadabra, form'd in Triangle, or Pyramid...How the poor People found the Insufficiency of those things, and how many of them were afterwards carried away in the Dead-Carts. Over time, the belief in the power of 'abracadabra' receded and in the 19th century it came to mean 'fake magic'. Terms like 'legal abracadabra' were used to denote the flummoxing of juries by fast-talking lawyers. Stage conjurors then adopted it into their inventory of the 'magic' words they used to punctuate their acts and the first known usage of it in that context dates from 1819.Some of these words, like 'hocus-pocus' (1634), 'abraxas' (1569) and 'hey presto' (1732) have a long history and a link to supernatural beliefs. Others, like hey-presto's American form 'presto changeo' (1905) and 'shazam' (1940) are pure stage patter.Younger readers may be familiar with the 'killing curse' from the Harry Potter books - 'avada kedavra', which appears to merge 'abracadabra' and 'cadaver'. UK residents of a certain age will always prefer the 'magic' spiel of Sooty and Sweep's mentor Harry Corbett - 'Izzy, Wizzy, let's get busy'

Forlorn hopeMeaningA hopeless or desperate enterprise.OriginLack of hope must have been a commonplace feeling amongst the English in the 19th century as they coined a variety of phrases to express it - 'not a hope in Hell', 'some hopes', 'what a hope' etc. To that list we might add 'forlorn hope'; but that would be an incorrect addition as it turns out.'Forlorn' derives from 'forlese', which just means 'lose', so 'forlorn hope' just means 'lost hope', which is the way it was understood in the 19th century, as it is now. That's not how it was in the 16th century, when a forlorn hope wasn't a world-weary feeling but a robust and gung-ho band of soldiers.Each troop in the British Army had a hand-picked group of soldiers, chosen for their ferocity and indifference to risk (and occasionally by using that tried and tested army method of "I want three volunteers. That's you, you and you."). They were the army's 'attack dogs' who risked all in reckless death or glory raids on the enemy.The Anglo-Norman terms 'avant-garde' and 'reregard', were adopted into English as 'vanguard' and 'rearguard' in the 14th century. They were the names of the forces that attacked from the front and protected the rear respectively. It seems reasonable to expect a group called the 'avant-garde' to be the first into battle but before them came the 'Forlorn Hope'. These soldiers, also called the 'forlorn boys' or 'forlorn fellows', were given little hope of survival by their peers. Lord Byron summed up the mind-set of the troop in the epic poem The Siege of Corinth, 1816:The foremost of the fierce assault.The bands are rank'd; the chosen vanOf Tartar and of Mussulman,The full of hope, misnamed "forlorn,"Who hold the thought of death in scorn,The first mention of them in print is found in Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande, 1577:Fortie or fiftie forlorne boies.Soon afterwards, the method of attack was described in John Dymmok's A Treatise of Ireland, circa 1600:Before the vantguarde marched the forelorn hope consisting of 40 shott and 20 shorte weapons, with order that they should not discharge vntil they presented theire peeces to the rebel breasts in their trenches, and that sooddenly the shorte weapons should enter the trenches pell mell.The choice of the name 'Forlorn Hope' for a group of soldiers who had little chance of survival seems straightforward and intuitive. Again, things aren't as they seem. The term was originally Dutch and the equivalent combative groups in Holland were called the 'Verloren Hoop', literally 'lost troop'. A bit of impromptu mistranslation amongst the British military turned this into 'Forlorn Hope'. The British Navy went a step further and their wildmen were known as the 'Flowing Hope'. Added to the 'Forlorn Hope' was the 'Rearlorn Hope'. These performed the same task whenever the rearguard was called on to retreat.Although the original meaning of 'forlorn hope' is largely lost to us now, it was still in use in 1920 when John Galsworthy wrote in The Forsyte Saga:"And round Crum were still gathered a forlorn hope of blue-bloods with a plutocratic following".The figurative meaning of 'forlorn hope', which describes someone in a hopeless plight but without any mention of warfare, overlapped with the original meaning for some years. In 1768, in Narrative of Travels in Patagonia, John Byron described the predicament of being forced to leave a group of his colleagues behind to certain death on an inhospitable island:We saw them a little after, setting out upon their forlorn hope, and helping one another over a hideous tract of rocks.As time progressed, a forlorn hope was thought of as something one experienced rather than something one belonged to. The 'rearlorn hope' took no such linguistic journey and has stayed exclusively within the army.

For good measureMeaningAs an additional extra.Origin'Good measure' has been part of the language since the first English-speaking 'purveyor of fyne goodes' set up shop, and it just means 'an ample or generous quantity of that which is sold by measure'.The first instance of the expression in print is found where many other first coinages originated, in John Wyclif's Middle English translation of the Bible, circa 1384, in Luke 6:38:Thei schulen yyue in to youre bosum a good mesure, and wel fillid, and schakun togidir, and ouerflowynge; for bi the same mesure, bi whiche ye meeten, it schal be metun ayen to you.[They shall give into your bosom a good measure, and well-filled, and shaken together, and overflowing; for by the same measure, by which ye mete, it shall be meted again to you.]We might expect the extended term 'in good measure' to refer to an abundance of something. In fact, its rather the reverse. 'Measured' also means 'moderate; restrained' and if a person acts 'in good measure' they are being especially temperate in their actions. As it happens, Wyclif was also one of the first to put that meaning of 'good measure' into print, in a collection of sermons known as Controversial Tracks, circa 1400, which was directed at the clergy:Ye shulden lyue on ye puple in good mesure as Paul biddin.[You be sustained by the people in moderation, as St. Paul bids you.]It wasn't until much later that the use of the phrase 'good measure' returned to its original 'ample' meaning. In the 19th century people began to express the idea of things being 'thrown in for good measure', that is, added as a complimentary extra portion. In 1811, the British mathematician Patrick Kelly wrote The Universal Cambist, which was an exhaustive study of the weights and measures in use in different parts of the world and a method of converting from one to another. In the notes on Swedish measurement he included:Corn, and other dry commodities, are measured by Tunnor. The Tunne is divided into 32 Kappar. But to every Tunna of wheat 4 Kappar are allowed for good measure.Before long, the expression 'for good measure' began to be used figuratively, that is, in circumstances where no actual measurement was taking place. An example appears in the May 1850 edition of the American magazineLittell's Living Age, in a report of a public flogging in California:'Give him another for good measure' - 'Hit him again' - were the sounds which greeted his ears.'For good measure' might appear to be linked to the 'Baker's dozen', as both phrases express the notion of a little extra being added above the absolute requirement. In fact, the two phrases aren't connected, 'Baker's dozen' being much older. While the extra that was added 'for good measure' was added willingly, the extra that made up a Baker's dozen was added under threat of severe punishment. In mediaeval England, being light in the loaves was as risky as being 'light in the loafers' was prior to the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the 1967 Sexual Offences Act.

May you live in interesting timesMeaningMay you experience much disorder and trouble in your life.OriginWhile purporting to be a blessing, this is in fact a curse. The expression is always used ironically, with the clear implication that 'uninteresting times', of peace and tranquillity, are more life-enhancing than interesting ones.'May you live in interesting times' is widely reported as being of ancient Chinese origin but is neither Chinese nor ancient, being recent and western. It certainly seems to have been intended to sound oriental, in the faux-Chinese 'Confucius he say' style, but that's as near to China as it actually gets. Confucius's actual sayings are as elusive as those of his western counterpart Aesop - we have no written records from either of them.The phrase was introduced in the 20th century in the form 'interesting age' rather than 'interesting times' and appears that way in the opening remarks made by Frederic R. Coudert at the Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, 1939,Some years ago, in 1936, I had to write to a very dear and honored friend of mine, who has since died, Sir Austen Chamberlain, brother of the present Prime Minister, and I concluded my letter with a rather banal remark, "that we were living in an interesting age." Evidently he read the whole letter, because by return mail he wrote to me and concluded as follows: "Many years ago, I learned from one of our diplomats in China that one of the principal Chinese curses heaped upon an enemy is, 'May you live in an interesting age.'" "Surely", he said, "no age has been more fraught with insecurity than our own present time." That was three years ago.This citation has to be treated with caution as Chamberlain didn't speak Chinese and never visited China, although he was in contact with diplomats stationed there during his time as British Foreign Secretary, that is, 1924-1929. We have the 1939 citation in print, so the 'interesting age' form must be at least that old. If we are to believe Coulson's assertion, the phrase dates from before 1936 and, if we trust in Chamberlain's recollection, we can push the origin back to pre-1929.As to the currently used 'interesting times' version, we can only date that to post WWII. In a speech to the 2nd session of the US Congress in August 1946, Senator Robert Byrd addressed a remark to Harry S. Truman:Mr. President, there is an old Chinese curse that says, 'May you live in interesting times.'Most generations think their times are especially troubling - now as ever. Senator Byrd probably had a better reason than many to call 1940s USA 'interesting', as it was less than a year after the US's use of atomic bombs and the surrender of Japan and Germany in WWII and only a month or two after Winston Churchill's 'Iron Curtain' speech, made in Fulton, Missouri, warning of the rise of Soviet power.

Bunny boilerMeaningAn obsessive and dangerous female, in pursuit of a lover who has spurned her.OriginThe expression 'bunny boiler' derives from the 1987 film Fatal Attraction, written by James Dearden and Nicholas Meyer. The plot centres around Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) obsessively pursuing her ex-lover Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas). The phrase comes from the plot device whereby Forrest, in a fit of frenzied jealousy, boils her erstwhile lover's daughter's pet rabbit. Gallagher's suspicions should have become aroused earlier, when Forrest was trying to persuade him to meet her, when she said "Bring the dog, I love animals... I'm a great cook."At the time that the phrase first came into general use it referred to someone unable to remain rational at the end of a romantic relationship. Very quickly that usage became moderated and it came to be used, often with some degree of irony, in much less extreme situations. Any needy, possessive or even just mildly annoying woman is now liable to be described as a 'bunny boiler'.The phrase is the modern equivalent of the woman referred to in the expression 'Hell has no fury like a woman scorned' which, in the competition for 'best-known phrases attributed to Shakespeare that were actually by someone else', runs 'music has charms to soothe the savage breast' into a close second place. Both these phrases were coined by William Congreve in 1697, in the play The Mourning Bride. For reasons that I'll leave others to explain, it is only women who are thought to become unhinged by being what is now graphically known as 'being dumped'. There's no male equivalent of 'a women scorned' or a 'bunny boiler'.As 'bunny boiler' is a recent phrase with such a clear source we are able to trace how it has found its way into popular use. It wasn't directly from the film, as the epithet isn't used in the dialogue, nor any of the advertising blurb used to promote it. As to who coined it, that's not clear, although it may well have been Glenn Close. The first use of it in print is from an interview Close gave to the US magazine the Ladies' Home Journal, reported in the Dallas Morning News on 6th December 1990:"There's nothing like portraying a psychopathic bunny-boiler to boost one's self-esteem, Glenn Close tells Ladies' Home Journal."Popular phrases that have found their way into the language since the emergence of the Internet appear first in online discussion groups, blogs and online newspapers. The earliest large archive of online colloquial messages is that of USENET groups, but Bunny boiler isn't found there until 1994, nor does it appear more than once or twice in the archives of US or British newspapers before that date.If the phrase were a commercial product then marketing people would say that it reached its target audience in 1994. It certainly saw a sudden and widespread use from then onwards and is now a commonly used phrase. Fatal Attraction was released in 1987 and Close referred to the phrase in 1990. Newly coined terms appear to spread in the community like viruses and, like flu viruses, they float around in the populace until they reach a threshold of infected cases, above which they spread rapidly. It appears that 'bunny boiler' got to that point sometime in 1994.

If the shoe fits, wear itMeaningIf a description applies to you, then accept it.This expression is often used when something derogatory is said about a person who then complains to a third party. The third party, if they agree with the original negative comment, might suggest "If the shoe fits, then wear it". An example of that might be:Jack: Just because I've missed two or three sessions, my fitness trainer says I lack motivation.Jill: Well, if the shoe fits, wear it. Origin'If the shoe fits, wear it' is often shortened to 'If the shoe fits...', leaving the listener to fill in the blank. The expression is the American version of the earlier British phrase 'If the cap fits, wear it', which is also still in general use. Daniel Defoe used the earlier phrase in the satirical poem The Dyet of Poland. Defoe had the work printed in London in 1705 but, as it was a rather vehement critique of the English parliament, Defoe used the flimsy pretence that it had been printed in Dantzig and was the work of 'Angliopoloski of Lithuania'. Defoe's point in the poem was that readers are responsible for their own opinions; he (or rather Angliopoloski) may have written the poem but that any conclusions drawn from it were owned by the reader, not him:Gentlemen, and if the Cap fits any Body let 'em wear it.'If the cap fits' is itself a version of a yet earlier phrase 'if the cloak sitteth fit', that is, 'if the cloak fits well'. This expression dates from the 16th century and was used in print by Richard Hooker in Of the Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie, 1593:Which cloake sitteth no lesse fit on the backe of their cause, then of the Anabaptists.The 'cloak' version of the phrase does suggest that the later 'cap' was a variant of 'cape'.As to 'if the shoe fits', that began being used in the late 18th century. The earliest example that I have found in print is from the US newspaper the New York Gazette & Weekly Mercury, May 1773:Why should Mr. Vanderbeck apply a general comparison to himself? Let those whom the shoe fits wear it.The change from cap to shoe may well have been influenced by the Cinderella story, which has a snug-fitting slipper as the primary plot device. Versions of the tale that include the 'lost slipper' scenario were well known in the USA and Europe by 1773. In 1634, Giambattista Basile, published Il Pentamerone, a popular collection of Italian folk tales. One of the stories, Cenerentola, is the basis of the Cinderella story as we now know it, complete with wicked stepmother, ugly sisters and a missing slipper.Many expressions, for example, 'toe the line', 'get off your high horse' etc., were first used literally and their metaphorical meaning came later. 'If the shoe fits' is a rarity in that it has gone the other way - having been used for centuries in a figurative sense, its most common usage now is in shoe shop advertising slogans.

Fathom outMeaningTo ascertain something; to deduce from the facts.OriginA fathom is one of those units of linear measurement that we learned at school (at least we did when I was at an English grammar school in the 14th century) and now can't quite remember just what length they refer to. There's the furlong (a 'furrow long', or the length of a mediaeval field - about 220 yards), the rod or pole or perch (all the same measurement - of five paces), the cubit (from the elbow to the fingertips). These peculiarly named units are matched in their imprecision by the fathom, which is the span encompassed by the outstretched arms from fingertip to fingertip - about six feet. Naturally, not everyone's arms were the same length and so the fathom wasn't an agreed distance. The woolliness over the definition of the term is illustrated in Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia, 1728:There are three kinds of Fathoms. The first, which is that of Men of War, contains six Feet: The middling, or that of Merchant Ships, five Feet, and a half; and the small one, used in Fluyts, Flyboats, and other Fishing-vessels, only five Feet.When we say that we fathom something now we mean that we grasp or understand it. In the Middle Ages to fathom something was, in keeping with the literal 'fingertip to fingertip' meaning of the word, to encircle it with the arms. From the 14th century onward, people who embraced each other were said to be fathoming. That meaning has now fallen out of use, which at least spares us from daily 'fathom and tell' stories in our tabloid newspapers.'Fathoming out' refers to measuring by using the outstretched arms, a usage that dates back to at least the 16th century; for example, this piece from Richard Eden's The Decades of the Newe Worlde, 1555:Seuen men... with theyr armes streached furthe were scarsely able too fathame them [trees] aboute.As time went by 'to fathom' began to mean 'to get to the bottom of' or 'to take soundings about'. This probably derives from the most commonly believed derivation of 'fathoming out', which is the measuring of the depth of water beneath a ship by use of a weight fixed to a rope marked out in fathoms. This 'sounding out' was known both literally and figuratively by the early 17th century; for example, this literal usage, recorded in Sir William Brereton's Travels in Holland, 1634:Fathoming the depth of the water over against Brill, we found it there where the buoys are placed to warn all seamen of the danger of that passage, that we had not above two feet more water than the ship drew.Philip Massinger's comic play A New Way to Pay Old Debts, 1633, makes a figurative use of 'fathoming', that is, a usage that makes no explicit reference to distance but which moves the meaning of 'fathoming' from 'getting the measure of' to 'understanding':The Statesman beleeues he fathomes The counsels of all Kingdomes on the earth.Fathoms are so strongly associated with seafaring that it seems unecessary to look any further than the nautical measurement as the source of 'fathom out', especially as this form of measuring was still commonplace when the term was coined.

Pony upMeaningPay money, especially a payment that is in arrears.Origin'Pony up' is very much an American phrase and most people in the USA will know its meaning, whereas elsewhere in the English-speaking world the expression is rarely used. In the UK we are more likely to 'stump up' and in Australia and New Zealand money is 'fronted up'. So what have ponies got to do with paying money?A pony is of course a small horse and that meaning has been in use since the mid-1600s. The word has several other slang meanings, including:- A small measure of alcohol (British, first documented in 1708)- A short crib sheet or study aid (American, 1827)- Twenty-five pounds (British slang, 1797)- An abridged news report (American, 1877) In the 1950s, 'pony' was also adopted as Cockney Rhyming Slang for 'rubbish; nonsense'. The full version of the rhyme is 'pony and trap' - and I'll leave it to you to figure out what 'trap' rhymes with.The first use of 'pony up' in print that I can find is in the Connecticut publication The Rural Magazine, May 1819:The afternoon, before the evening, the favoured gentlemen are walking rapidly into the merchant-tailors shops, and very slowly out, unless they ponied up the Spanish [the money].It is most likely that the expression was coined in the USA, but a claim can also be made for a British origin. 'Pony up' was recorded in the UK in the 19th century, in Thomas Darlington's glossary Folk-speech of South Cheshire, 1887:Pony, to pay. To 'pony out' = 'stump out'; a slang term.Clearly, that is later than the American first usage, but how long it had been in vernacular use in England before Darlington recorded it is difficult to say. It is unlikely that the term migrated to Cheshire from the USA; migrations, of people and of language, were largely in the other direction at that date.Whatever the location of the first use, it is clear from the 'pay money' meaning of 'pony up' that the pony in question is some form of currency or donation. The British 'twenty five pounds' meaning is a possibility, but seems rather too specific an amount; after all we can 'pony up' any amount. In fact, none of the numerous meanings of 'pony' appear to fit the bill and it may be that we are backing the wrong horse.Enter stage right, a dark horse of another colour. The English quarter day of March 25th was the day that debts were settled and payments were made. The first two words of the fifth division of Psalm 119, which was always sung at Matins on the 25th day of the month, are 'Legem pone'. The term became associated with the payment of debts and was used as an allusive expression for 'payment of money; cash down'. That meaning of 'legem pone' was recorded as early as 1570 by Thomas Tusser in Hundreth Good Pointes Husbandry:Use Legem pone to pay at thy day,Was that the source of the term 'pony up' and should we really be spelling it 'pone up'? Well, we don't know for certain but, in a two-horse race, it seems a better place for your money than the eponymous pony.

'Jack' phrasesThe origin of the many phrases that contain the name JackIf it is true, as I'm sure it is, that the phrases in a language define a culture's interests and preoccupations then the English-speaking world must be fascinated by people. English phrases frequently include names. Some of these refer to actual individuals, for example, 'Gordon Bennett!', 'Sweet Fanny Adams' and the numerous people referred to in Cockney rhyming slang, but more often than not the person referred to is imaginary. Examples of phrases that include invented names are 'the life of Riley', 'heavens to Betsy' and 'moaning Minnie'.Jack appears in more phrases than does any other name. That might be expected as Jack is a colloquial form of John and, for the period in which the majority of these phrases were coined, John was the most common boy's name amongst English speakers. Jack was the generic name for the common man; a lad, a fellow, a chap, but also with the hint of knave or likeable rogue. 'John' appears in our phrases and sayings hardly at all and this is probably because 'Jack' was considered the more interesting character. The use of 'Jack' with the meaning of 'young rogue' dates back to the 16th century and examples are known from Nicholas Udall and others in Middle English. An early example in a form of English that is easily accessible to us now is found in Shakespeare's Taming of Shrew, circa 1616:A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jacke.Some well-known linguistic Jacks are:- Jack the Lad - a self-assured young man who is a bit of a rogue. This is the archetypal Jack; young, roguish and male. See more about Jack the Lad...- Jack Tar - sailors coated their clothes and the ropes of their ships to make them weatherproof. They even smeared their hair and beards to avoid stray wisps getting caught in the rigging. What better name for sailors than Jack Tar?- Jack of all trades - the common man, who will turn his hand to any form of work. See more about Jack of all trades...- Jack Robinson - in the phrase 'Before you can say Jack Robinson'. Possibly a rare example of a Jack that was a real person. See more about Jack Robinson...- All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy - this proverbial expression has been known since 1670.Jack was the name given to many of the sprites, imps and supernatural creatures that were imagined to have human form, for example, Jack Frost (an imp that nips our ears and toes with cold), Jack o' lantern (a fairy that lives in hedges), Jack-in-irons (a malevolent giant).Jacks, being typically young and mischievous, feature strongly in nursery rhymes, for example, Little Jack Horner, Jack Sprat and Jack and Jill. The latter two of these pre-date their appearance in nursery rhyme. Jack Sprat was the name given to any dwarf from the 16th century onward and Jack and Jill was used as the name of any young couple as early as the 1450s.Cockney Rhyming Slang has an association with roguish street trading and is another linguistic area where Jacks flourish. Examples are: Jack Palancing (dancing), On your Jack (Jones > alone), Jack-in-the box (pox), Jack Randle (candle).I've not listed every man Jack as there are so many - the OED includes over hundred of them. Time to jack it in I think.

Double DutchMeaningNonsense; gibberish - a language one cannot understand.OriginThere are a host of phrases in English that include the word 'Dutch'; that's hardly surprising as The Netherlands is just a few miles across the sea from England. We don't have anything like as many expressions that include 'French', so why the interest in 'Dutch'? Two reasons: trade and war.Both England and Holland (which is what most people call The Netherlands), have a vigorous and wide-ranging maritime trading tradition that dates back to the 16th century. England imported many commodities from Holland and gave them 'Dutch' names. The first of these imports was 'Dutch sauce', which we now call Hollandaise. Claudius Hollyband referred to this in the French Schoole Maister, 1573:Will you eate of a Pike with a high dutche sauce?Many other examples followed:Dutch cheese - first used in 1700.Dutch barn - 1742.Dutch hoe - 1742.Dutch oven - 1769.The Anglo-Dutch wars of the 17th and 18th centuries were acrimonious even by the usual standards of war. Following the conflicts the English came to hold the Dutch in very low regard and as a consequence there are numerous English phrases which portray them in an unflattering light, often as skinflints or drunkards. The common strand in all of these disparaging 'Dutch' expressions is that anything Dutch is the opposite of what it ought to be. Examples of these expressions are:Dutch bargain - a bargain made when one is debilitated by drink - first recorded in 1654.Dutch defence - a legal defence in which the defendant seeks clemency by deceitfully betraying others - 1749.Dutch comfort - cold comfort; only good because things could have been worse - 1796.Dutch metal/Dutch gold - a cheap alloy resembling gold - 1825.Dutch courage - brash bravery induced by drink - 1826.Dutch treat - no treat as such; each person pays for their own expenses - 1887.Added to that list is 'double Dutch'. The Anglo-Dutch wars were a very long time ago and we are all friends now, but at this point we can introduce another reason for the English to have held on so long to hostile stereotyping of the Dutch, that is, the link with the UK's 20th century military rivals, the Germans. 'Dutch' was originally the generic name for both Germans and, as they were formally called, Hollanders. High Dutch was the language of southern Germany and Low Dutch the language of The Netherlands.Double Dutch is in fact a synonym for High Dutch and as such is a slur on the Germans rather than the Dutch, although the distinction may not have been apparent to the average 18th century English sailor. Charles Dibdin was the first to allude to the incomprehensibility of the language, in Collected Songs, 1790:Why, I heard our good chaplain palaver one day,About souls, heaven, mercy and such;And, my timbers! what lingo he'd coil and belay,-Why, 'twas just all as one as High Dutch.The earliest example of 'double Dutch' that I have found is in John Davis' Travels of Four Years and a Half in the United States of America, 1803, in which the author spoke to a colleague in Welsh:"Mr Adams - What devil language is that? Is it double Dutch coiled against the sun?"The coiling that was referred to in both the above citations was the winding of rope. Sailors called anti-clockwise winding 'coiling against the sun'. This was generally disparaged and an indication that 'double Dutch' was the linguistic equivalent of a badly coiled rope. Most of the early citations of 'double Dutch' are in their full form 'double Dutch coiled against the sun'. We can safely assume that what was meant by 'double Dutch' was 'Dutch that is malformed and twisted' rather than 'Dutch, twice over'.

What you see is what you get (wysiwyg)MeaningA computer screen display which appears on screen as it will be seen when printed on paper.Origin'Wysiwyg', pronounced 'whizzywig', is one of the best-known of all acronyms. It is generally supposed that the phrase 'what you see is what you get', the acronym 'wysiwyg' and the computer interface that they referred to emerged in close succession. This isn't the case; each of those elements has its own independent genesis.Firstly, the phrase. 'What you see is what you get' is widely reported as being coined by Flip Wilson in performances as his drag character Geraldine in Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in the late 1960s and then later on The Flip Wilson Show. Wilson certainly popularized the expression but it was already in general use before he adopted it as a catchphrase. A form of the phrase had been used by advertisers in the USA since at least the 1940s to indicate a straightforward, no-fuss form of trading. An advert for a Filmo Sportster camera in The Charleston Gazette came close to 'what you see is what you get' in November 1949:You just sight, press a button and what you see, you get!The precise phrase came into print some years later. For instance, this text from an advert for a house sale, in The Oakland Tribune, May 1966:"So with the exception of landscaping and decorator furnishings, what you see is what you get."Next comes the acronym 'wysiwyg'. This is generally thought to have been coined from the phrase and in reference to the graphical computer user interfaces that were emerging from Xerox PARC in the 1970s, but it isn't known who first used the acronym in that context. The first such reference that I can find comes surprisingly late, in Byte magazine, April 1982:'What you see is what you get' (or WYSIWYG) refers to the situation in which the display screen portrays an accurate rendition of the printed page.However, he first citation I have found of the acronym in print comes several years earlier in a non-computer related context. In January 1972, a student business competition was organised in Victoria, Texas and an account of it published in the local newspaper the Victoria Advocate on the 23rd January. Each team of students chose a name for the dummy businesses that they were going to manage. They were clearly encouraged to use acronyms, as the names they chose were:SPOT - Selling Products of TomorrowLIFE - Lets Insure Future ExistenceWYSIWYG - What You See Is What You GetSo, unless earlier computer related citations are found - which would that seem unlikely as the first wysiwyg software didn't emerge until after 1972 - the prize for coining 'wysiwyg' goes to a bunch of Texan high school kids, not to the boffins of Palo Alto.'What you see is what you get' later came to be used in a general context, often by individuals - like Flip Wilson's Geraldine - to describe themselves. It is shorthand for 'I may be a plain-speaking rough diamond, but I have no hidden agenda - let my reputation precede me', in the same way that people used to say 'take me as you find me'. The British entrepreneur Sir Alan Sugar is known for such an attitude and used 'What You See Is What You Get' as the title of his autobiography.

A norangeOriginIn 1914, the Danish grammarian Otto Jespersen coined the term 'metanalysis'. That's rather a dry start to a piece on what is a lively and intriguing facet of the English language. To find out what prompted Jespersen to believe that we needed a new word, let's bring in a stage prop - the humble orange.Many sources will tell you that oranges were originally called noranges and that 'a norange' migrated to being called 'an orange'. Well, like so much folk etymology, that's not true, but there is a germ of truth in it. There never has been a word 'norange' in English, although there very nearly was.The climate in England doesn't qualify it as a specialist orange-growing area and the fruit were first imported there in the 14th century. Oranges originated in South-east Asia and when they arrived in Persia and Spain they were given the names 'narang' and 'naranja' respectively. As they got nearer to England, and hence nearer to requiring a name in English, they lost the 'n'. This on happened their journey through France, where they were known as 'pomme d'orenge'.In English, the indefinite article may be 'a' or 'an', depending on whether it is followed by a word which starts with a consonant or a vowel. When the consonant is an 'n', we may run into the 'a norange'/'an orange' confusion. It was this displacement of a letter from one word to another that Jespersen took an interest in and named 'metanalysis'. Mediaeval words like 'a napperon', 'a nuncle' and 'a nadder' could easily be confused in everyday speech with 'an apron', 'an uncle' and 'an adder' - and they were. The earlier forms aren't now used.The misaligning of word boundaries can go the other way too, with the 'n' being added rather than lost. The best-known examples of that are 'nickname' and 'newt', which were originally 'an eke-name' and 'an ewt'.It's easy for us to see these examples now as obvious errors, but bear in mind that the changing of words based on confusion about where words start and end took place before dictionaries or even printing and reading were commonplace. When we come across new words now it is just as likely that we see them in print as to hear them spoken. If we had to rely on speech alone we might now be coining mutations like 'an erd' or 'a Niphone'.

Pig's earMeaningAs 'pig's ear' - Cockney rhyming slang for beer. As 'in a pig's ear' - an expression of disbelief. As 'make a pig's ear of ' - make a mess or muddle.OriginThe Cockney rhyming slang version of 'pig's ear' is easiest to explain. It's one of the earliest examples of the form and appears in D. W. Barrett's Life & Work among Navvies, 1880:"Now, Jack, I'm goin' to get a tiddley wink of pig's ear."That's easy enough to decipher as "I'm going to get a drink of beer", although you would need a Cockney for an explanation of why 'tiddley wink of pig's ear' was thought to be an improvement on 'drink of beer'. 'Pig's ear' rhymes with 'beer' and that's usually enough for rhyming slang. Franklin's Dictionary of Rhyming Slang lists several alternatives for 'beer' - 'Charlie Freer', 'far and near', 'never fear', 'oh my dear', 'red steer', 'Crimea', and 'fusilier' but 'pig's ear' has always been the most popular.The version 'in a pig's ear' is also perplexing. It originated in the USA in the 1850s as a variant of 'in a pig's eye'. Both phrases were used as expressions of incredulous disbelief and have the same meaning as 'tell it to the marines'. They may possibly be related to 'pigs might fly'. See this link for more on 'in a pig's ear'.'Make a pig's ear' is a mid 20th century phrase and means 'completely botch something up; make a complete mess of it'. This is first found in print in a 1950 edition of the Reader's Digest:"If you make a pig's ear of the first one, you can try the other one."The expression derives from the old proverb 'you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear', which dates from the 16th century. The English clergyman Stephen Gosson published the romantic story Ephemerides in 1579 and in it referred to people who were engaged in a hopeless task:"Seekinge too make a silke purse of a Sowes eare."'Make a pig's ear of' alludes to what might be the result if someone did try to make something from a sow's ear - not a silk purse but a complete mess.

The writing is on the wallMeaningImminent danger has become apparent.Origin'The writing is on the wall' is also sometimes expressed as 'the handwriting is on the wall' or as 'mene mene'. The first of those variations is an obvious synonym but what does 'mene mene' mean? This is a shortening of 'mene mene tekel upharsin', which is of Aramaic origin. If your Aramaic isn't that strong you can get some guidance from the Bible, Daniel 5, in the story of Belshazzar's feast. To cut a long Old Testament story short, Belshazzar was indulging in a drunken revelry and debasing sacred temple vessels by using them as wine goblets when a disembodied hand wrote 'mene mene tekel upharsin' on the palace wall.On the face of it, and using a literal translation, this appeared meaningless. The expression seemed to mean 'two minas, a shekel and two parts' or alternatively 'numbered, weighed, divided'. None of this meant much to Belshazzar, who decided that he needed further interpretation and sent for the Jewish exile Daniel. It then became clear that the phrase was an elaborate wordplay, relying on the fact that each word can denote a different coin, and the third word can be interpreted as 'Persia'. Daniel's interpretation, as recorded in the first easily understood English version of the Bible, the King James Version, 1611, was:And this the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.The point of the moral tale was that Belshazzar couldn't see the warning that was apparent to others because he was engrossed with his sinning ways.The subtlety of the biblical wordplay is now somewhat lost on those of us that don't speak ancient Aramaic. Perhaps a flavour of the style can be conveyed by comparing it to the lyrics of the popular World War II novelty song Mairzy Doats:Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy diveyaA kiddley divey too, wooden shoe?Literally, that's meaningless but a wartime Daniel could have translated it into its actual meaning:Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy,A kid'll eat ivy too, wouldn't you?'Writing on the wall' began to be used figuratively, that is providing warnings where no actual writing or walls are involved, from the early 18th century; for example, Jonathan Swift's Miscellaneous works, 1720:A baited Banker thus desponds, From his own Hand foresees his Fall; They have his Soul who have his Bonds; 'Tis like the Writing on the Wall.

The whole nine yardsEvery now and then I feel the urge to go back to the Holy Grail of etymology - 'the whole nine yards'. I was prompted to take another look at it this week by the unveiling of the British Library Newspaper Archive. This gives online access to a vast store of British newspapers, which will eventually include the majority of all newspapers printed in Britain since the early 1700s. Just the place to try a search for an early printed example of 'the whole nine yards' n'est-ce pas? Well, yes and no.If you aren't familiar with the search for the origin of that elusive expression, here's the story so far...•For reasons that aren't clear, 'the whole nine yards' provokes more speculative derivations than any other phrase. Many people are convinced they know the origin but aren't able to provide documentary evidence to support their chosen belief. •The earliest known citation of the phrase in print is from 1962. In May 1961, the American athlete Ralph Boston broke the world long jump record with a jump of 27 feet 1/2 inch. No one had previously jumped 27 feet. This was big news at the time and surely cried out for this headline: "Boston jumps the whole nine yards"If the phrase was in circulation before 1961, it wasn't known to that most slang-aware troop, newspaper journalists, and no one came up with that line, which is missing from all newspaper archives. The absence of the expression in print prior to the 1960s argues strongly against any of the supposed mediaeval, Victorian or even World War II origins.•The weight of circumstantial evidence is that the phrase originated in America in the early 1960s but it isn't known who coined the term. Sadly, the new archive yielded no results. That's not altogether surprising, as it is reasonably certain that the phrase is of 20th century American origin. The British Library database did come up with a story from 1821 of a stagecoach toppling off a cliff and falling 'full nine yards', but that doesn't carry the current meaning of the phrase and appears to be a straightforward literal report.Nevertheless, the digitisation of old manuscripts provides etymologists with a gateway to sources that were previously inaccessible. The American academic Stephen Goranson recently found this piece in a newly digitised copy of Michigan's Voices: A Literary Quarterly & Arts Magazine, Fall 1962:... real civilized living in the modern urban home - then the dog would catch on and go ki-yi-yi-ing from one to the other of the shouting pyjama clad participants - mad, mad, mad, the consequence of house, home, kids, respectability, status as a college professor and the whole nine yards, as a brush salesman who came by the house was fond of saying, ...Also in late 1962, this passage appeared in a letter to the editor in an issue of Car Life, also now available in online format:Your staff of testers cannot fairly appraise the Chevrolet Impala sedan, with all nine yards of goodies, against the Plymouth Savoy.The meanings of the word 'yard' are many and varied. We have linear, square or cubic yards, also yard-arms, steelyards etc. This is the source of the variability of the many guesses at the phrase's origin. These include:•The nine cubic yards capacity of US concrete trucks. Widely circulated, although clearly nonsense as even the largest concrete mixers were smaller than 9 cubic yards in the 1960s. •World War II aircraft. There are several aircraft-related theories:•The length of US bombers' bomb racks. •The length of the RAF Spitfire's machine gun bullet belts. •The length of ammunition belts in ground based anti-aircraft turrets, etc. •The amount of material used in making top quality suits. Supporters of this theory sometimes relate it to 'dressed to the nines'.•The derivation is naval and the yards are shipyards. Another naval version is that the yards are the spars of sailing ships. The name for the spar that hold the sails is a yard. Large sailing ships had three masts, often with three yards on each. The theory goes that ships in battle can continue changing direction as new sails are unfurled. Only when the last sail, on the ninth yard, is used do the enemy know in which direction the ship is finally headed.Despite the certainty of the proponents of each of these explanations, at best only one of them can be correct. The evidence argues against any of them being the origin of the phrase. What the above digitised documentary evidence actually points to is that the phrase in its earliest incarnations refers to a 'laundry list' of items.Speculation will of course continue until a definitive source for the phrase is found. I'm not holding my breath but, if an origin is found, I've no doubt that it will be as the result of a search of a digitised archive.

As different as chalk and cheeseMeaningTwo things that are very different from each other.OriginWe have hundreds of phrases to indicate the similarity of one thing with another and similes like 'as alike as two peas in a pod' are commonplace in everyday speech. However, there are very few phrases that do the opposite and refer to the difference between things, and prominent amongst these is is 'as different as chalk and cheese'. This is an old expression and the earliest citation of it is in John Gower's Middle English text Confessio Amantis, 1390:Lo, how they feignen chalk for chese.Tourist boards in several of the chalkland areas of the UK try to place the phrase's origin in their locality and allude to vague connections between chalk and the local cheese. None of these are convincing and they clearly owe more to marketing than to etymology. So, how did the phrase come about?There must have been a time in the development of English when we had no standard phrase to express the idea that two things were 'as different as X and Y'. When someone coined such a phrase, and that someone may well have been Gower in 1390, clearly he needed candidates for the roles of X and Y. That doesn't sound difficult, after all most things are different from most other things."Maybe, 'as different as a cormorant and a lamp-post'", thinks our coiner, "or 'as different as floorboards and greengrocers'". "No, 'as different as chalk and cheese' sounds better". Why? For no better reason that the fact the 'chalk' and 'cheese' are short and snappy words that alliterate. The English language is packed full of phrases that contain pairs of rhyming or alliterating words - often just because the person who coined them liked the sound of them; for example, hocus-pocus, the bee's knees, riff-raff etc.A modern-day spin-off of 'chalk and cheese' is 'chalk and talk'. This refers to the traditional teaching method where the teacher stood at the front to address the class while writing on the blackboard with a stick of chalk (which those of a certain age will well remember). The phrase emerged in the UK in the 1930s but had a shortish run as a widely used expression as classrooms began to be equipped with whiteboards in the 1960s. 'Dry-wipe marker pen and talk' never caught on.

Second-guessMeaning1. To criticize and offer advice, with the benefit of hindsight.2. To foresee the actions of others, before they have come to a decision themselves.OriginA commonly used meaning of 'to second-guess' is to criticize the actions of others, after the event. The event in questions was, and often still is, a sporting event. The term is derived as what is known as a back-formation. As back-formations loom large in etymology I'll break off to explain what they are.New words are usually created from existing words. For example, we all know what 'fishing' means and, armed with that knowledge we could easily coin the word 'fisherman' and a phrase like 'fishing for compliments'. Sometimes though, the order that words and phrases are derived in isn't so obvious. For example, people who rob from houses have been called 'burglars' since the 13th century and it might be supposed that they got their name from being engaged in 'burglary'. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that the legal profession decided that 'that thing that burglars do' needed to be given a name and hence 'burglary' was coined as a back-formation from 'burglar'. Likewise, 'narration' and 'scavenge', which were coined centuries after 'narrator' and 'scavenger'.The same back route was taken by the phrase 'second-guess'. The umpire in a baseball game used to be called, rather unkindly, 'the guesser'. People who were continually telling the guesser, the manager or the players what they were doing wrong were known as 'secondguessers' and were so defined in the Sporting News Record Book, 1937:Secondguesser, one who is continually criticizing moves of players and manager.Another meaning of 'to second-guess' is to anticipate what others might do in a particular situation. This is also of American origin but, somewhat more impressively, refers to a guess made before rather than after the event. An early example of its use comes from Broadcasting magazine, December 1941:Do not try to second-guess or master-mind our military officials. Leave this for established military analysts and experts, who are experienced enough to await the facts before drawing conclusions.

Security blanketMeaning1. A small familiar blanket or other soft fabric item carried by a child for reassurance.2. A form of harness for a baby's crib.3. All-encompassing military and political security measures.OriginThe term 'security blanket', also known as 'comfort blanket', was coined by Charles Shulz for his Peanuts cartoon strip. That's what most references will tell you. It's always a pleasure to swim against the tide and here's an opportunity. In fact, the term 'security blanket' wasn't coined by Charles Shulz for his Peanuts cartoon strip. The derivation of 'security blanket' involves a rather meandering tale, which goes like this:Security blankets were known to Americans in the 1920s and were at that date overblankets which were clipped into babies' cribs to stop the occupants falling out. The accompanying advert is from the New York newspaper The Republican Press, November 1925, advertising fasteners for such a blanket for 59 cents.The tale now moves on to World War II. The term 'security blanket' was then used to refer to strict security measures that were taken to keep Allied military plans from falling into the hands of the Germans. The term was coined in that context by the US military while fighting in Europe. For example, this report from the Alabama newspaper The Dothan Eagle, September 1944:Reports being issued at Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters sometimes were as much as 48 hours behind the armies because of a security blanket thrown over the operations.Incidentally, another article from the same page as the above is titled 'British Take Brussels', which is timely as this [28th December] is the only week of the year that the headline could be recycled. For those of a non-British persuasion, many in Britain pile their Christmas dinner plates with brussels sprouts with some enthusiasm but reject them with distaste for the rest of the year.The emergence of the military use of 'security blanket' about twenty years after the use of the term in a domestic setting does suggest the possibility that those coining a new meaning for it were the babies that were tucked up under security blankets a generation earlier.Now we move on another step, to the use of the expression as 'a small familiar comforter for babies and toddlers'. Now we get to Charles Shulz, right? Not quite. Shulz drew the character Linus van Pelt with a comfort blanket in the Peanuts cartoon strip in June 1954. It wasn't until 1956, in Good Grief, More Peanuts, that the item was given a name by Linus:"This is a 'security and happiness' blanket. All little kids carry them."By that date the term had been in use elsewhere. The November 1954 issue of the California newspaper The Daily Review included this piece by a staff writer, under the name of 'Bev':'Security blanket. My younger child is one year old. When she finds a fuzzy blanket or a fleecy coat she presses her cheek against it and sucks her thumb.'

A square mealMeaningA substantial, nourishing meal.OriginIt is frequently repeated, by tour guides and the like, that the expression 'a square meal' originated from the Royal Navy practice of serving meals on square wooden plates. Such plates did exist so that is a plausible story, but there's no other evidence to support it. In fact, the lateness of the first printed record (see below) pretty well rules this out as a credible theory. The Royal Navy's records and many thousands of ship's logs are still available and, if the phrase came from that source, it would surely have been recorded before the mid-19th century.This 'square plate' theory is one of the best-known examples of folk-etymology. The phrase exists, the square plates exist, and two and two make five. To be more precise, what we have here is a back-formation. Someone hears the phrase 'square meal' and then invents a plausible story to fit it.The word square has many meanings, including 'proper, honest, straightforward', and that's the meaning in 'square meal'. This isn't a rectilinear meal on right-angled crockery, but a good and satisfying meal.The phrase is of US origin. All the early citations are from America, including this, the earliest print reference I have found - an advertisement for the Hope and Neptune restaurant, in the California newspaper The Mountain Democrat, November 1856:"We can promise all who patronize us that they can always get a hearty welcome and 'square meal' at the 'Hope and Neptune. Oyster, chicken and game suppers prepared at short notice."William Brohaugh, in the usually reliable 'English Through the Ages', dates the saying as having entered the language in 1840, although no supporting evidence is provided. There certainly was a spate of coinages of 'food words' in the USA around that date. The terms below all originated in the 1830s and 40s:Chili con carneClambakeCottage cheese CupcakeGazpachoJerkyRestaurantTea cakeTenderloin Tutti-fruttiSeafoodThe use of 'square' to mean honest and straightforward goes back to at least the 16th century; for example, in 1591, in Robert Greene's Defence of Conny Catching:"For feare of trouble I was fain to try my good hap at square play."Soon after that, Shakespeare used it in Anthony and Cleopatra, 1606:"She's a most triumphant Lady, if report be square to her."Other phrases use the word with that same meaning, for example, 'fair and square', 'square play', square deal' etc. but these haven't had spurious derivations invented for them. Coincidentally, another phrase - the opposite of 'fair and square' - also has a false derivation relating to plates in the Royal Navy. The story goes like this. The square wooden plates that sailors received their food on had raised edges called 'fiddles'. If they took too much they were 'on the fiddle'. Perhaps 'story' is being too kind; invention might be more accurate. The evidence for the prosecution is:- There is no record of the edges of sailors' plates having any name, let alone a fiddle. No dictionary I can find lists that meaning. - Despite searching high and low, I've not been able to find any citation of the phrase 'on the fiddle' from before the 20th century, apart from those that clearly mean 'playing the violin'. There are several old 'fiddle' phrases - 'fiddle faddle', 'fiddling while Rome burns', 'second fiddle' etc., but no 'on the fiddle'.In support of the story there is - well, nothing. It's never possible to prove a negative so, if you hear that derivation from a tour guide and ask for evidence they might just provide it. Don't bet the mortgage on it though; you're more likely to spot Elvis playing tiddlywinks with Lord Lucan.

A frog in the throatMeaningTemporary hoarseness caused by phlegm in the back of the throat.Origin'A frog in the throat' is an American phrase that entered the language towards the end of the 19th century. The expression doesn't have a fanciful derivation (see more on that below) but comes directly from the fact that a hoarse person sounds croaky - like a frog.The earliest reference I can find to the expression is from How to be Man, which was an improving 'book for boys', written by the American clergyman Harvey Newcomb in 1847. Newcomb encouraged the youngsters to resist the temptation of 'improper diversions' [the nature of which I will leave to your imagination]:Now let me beg of you to learn to say NO. If you find a 'frog in your throat,' which obstructs your utterance, go by yourself, and practise saying no, no, NO!The expression must have been in popular use in the USA by 1894, when it was used in an advertisement as the name of a proprietary medicine for sore throats, inThe Stevens Point Journal, November 1894:"The Taylor Bros. say that 'Frog in the Throat' will cure hoarseness. 10 cents and box."Interestingly, a reference to the phrase was printed just four weeks later in the English newspaper The Hastings and St Leonards Observer, in an article about 'Yankee advertising'. The Observer journalist describes how a local chemist had adopted an American advertising window display in order to sell the imported 'Frog in Your Throat' lozenges. The display consisted of artificial frogs dressed up as English peasants and arranged in a variety of tableaux entitled 'Merrie England in Ye Olden Time'. In order to lend some zest to the sales campaign, the advertising agents for the importers invented a back story which claimed that 'a frog in the throat' was 'an old English expression, once in common use, but now forgotten here'. That story is as fake as the stuffed frogs - the expression is certainly American and only became widely used in England when Taylor Bros. began selling their lozenges.That 'old English' story, which is often elaborated with the explanatory text 'in medieval times physicians thought that the secretions of a frog could help heal a sore throat', is one of the pieces of folk etymology that appear to float around the Internet and enjoy apparent immortality, despite having no basis in truth and no supporting evidence. As a general rule, any explanation of the origin of a phrase that begins with 'In medieval times...' should be treated with suspicion.

A tissue of liesMeaningA story invented in order to deceive.OriginIf you use a search engine to search for 'tissues' you will find many pictures of paper handkerchiefs and of human skin - that's what 'tissue' means to us these days. So, whence the phrase 'a tissue of lies'? It might be thought that the meaning derives from the filmy nature of tissue and that this had been taken up as a metaphor for lies that were easy to see through and would readily break down on examination. That's not an unreasonable assumption but is in fact completely wide of the mark.For the correct meaning of 'tissue of lies' we have to go back to the 14th century meaning of 'tissue', that is, 'an intricately woven ornamental cloth'. That meaning is first recorded in the Middle English allegorical poem The Romaunt of the Rose, circa 1366:The barres [decorative straps] were of gold ful fyne, Upon a tyssu of satyne.The defining characteristic of tissues was the complexity of their weaving. A 'tissue of lies' is a complex, interwoven series of lies, not a flimsy and unconvincing one.The figurative meaning of the intermingling of characteristics, usually of a bad kind, began to be used in the 18th century. From then onward, any combination of 'a network/web/fabric/tissue of absurdity/error/falsehood' can be found somewhere in literature. Of these, only 'tissue of lies' has withstood the test of time. The phrase began to be used in the early 19th century, as in this example from the London journal, The Monthly Review, January 1800:The ingenuity and cunning of politicians are not infrequently employed to conceal or misinterpret facts; and venal writers are easily found, ready to construct a tissue of lies to serve the purposes of their employers.By the way, there's no truth that the word 'atishoo' derives from the handkerchief meaning of 'tissue' - that's just atishoo of lies.

Fob offMeaningTo put off deceitfully; to attempt to satisfy with something of inferior quality or something less than one has been led to expect.OriginIn 1980, Margaret Thatcher's government introduced the Community Charge in Britain. This highly unpopular tax, which was known colloquially as the Poll Tax, was firmly rejected by the British populace and initiated Thatcher's political demise. Step back 600 years to England's first Peasants' Revolt, also instigated by a clumsy attempt to install a Poll Tax by an unpopular government - the advisers of the 14-year-old King Richard II.On a pleasant May morning in 1381, the king's tax collector John Brampton rode into the Essex village of Fobbing to collect the poll tax of 3 groats from each of the local villagers. The villagers gathered together, Brampton was sent packing and the Peasants' Revolt had begun. Ask anyone in the village today and they will tell you that Brampton wasn't just turned away, he was 'fobbed off' - "...and that's how the expression 'fobbed off' originated".As is often the case with phrases that a local tourist office would like to appropriate for their neighbourhood (like 'Paint the town red' and 'Cock and bull story' for example), the link between the language and the place is spurious. Nice village it may be and the peasants there may be revolting, but 'fobbing off' has nothing to do with Fobbing.'Fob' is known in English as a verb meaning 'to delude or impose upon' only since the 16th century - 200 years after Brampton was given the bum's rush out of Fobbing. The word is probably an import from Germany, where the earlier term 'foppen' has the same meaning.The English playwright Robert Greene used the term in the romantic prose poem Mamillia, a mirrour or looking glasse for the ladies of England, 1583:I will not... fobbe you with fayre wordes, and foule deedes.Greene is best known as a contributor to the pamphlet A Groats-Worth of Wit, which is widely interpreted as an attack on Shakespeare. Nevertheless, Shakespeare was happy to pick up 'fobbed' (as 'fubd' in his original manuscript) and used it in a speech by Mistress Quickly in Henry IV Part II:I have borne, and borne, and borne, and have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on.So, if you want phrase derivations we are here for you, don't be fobbed off with tour guide stories.

Halcyon daysMeaningCalm, peaceful days.OriginThe Halcyon is a bird of Greek legend and the name is now commonly given to the European Kingfisher. The ancients believed that the bird made a floating nest in the Aegean Sea and had the power to calm the waves while brooding her eggs. Fourteen days of calm weather were to be expected when the Halcyon was nesting - around the winter solstice, usually 21st or 22nd of December. The Halcyon days are generally regarded as beginning on the 14th or 15th of December.The source of the belief in the bird's power to calm the sea originated in a myth recorded by Ovid. The story goes that Aeolus, the ruler of the winds, had a daughter named Alcyone, who was married to Ceyx, the king of Thessaly. Ceyx was drowned at sea and Alcyone threw herself into the waves in a fit of grief. Instead of drowning, she was transformed into a bird and carried to her husband by the wind.The myth came to the English-speaking world in the 14th century, when, in 1398, John Trevisa translated Bartholomew de Glanville's De proprietatibus rerum into Middle English:"In the cliffe of a ponde of occean, Alcion, a see foule, in wynter maketh her neste and layeth egges in vii days and sittyth on brood ... seuen dayes."By the 16th century the phrase 'halcyon days' had lost its association with the nesting time of the bird and had taken on the figurative meaning of 'calm days'. Shakespeare used the expression that way in Henry VI, Part I, 1592:Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,Since I have entered into these wars.Note: Saint Martin's summer is what we now know as an Indian summer.The kingfisher is associated with other powers relating to the weather. In mediaeval times it was thought that if the dried carcass of a kingfisher was hung up it would always point its beak in the direction of the wind [don't try this at home]. Shakespeare also refers to this belief, in King Lear, 1605:Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaksWith every gale and vary of their mastersOur current use of 'halcyon days' tends to be nostalgic and recalling of the seemingly endless sunny days of youth - despite the fact that the original halcyon days were in the depths of winter.

On the fiddleMeaningEngaged in a fraud.Origin'Fiddling' is usually meant to mean 'cheating in a petty way', perhaps falsifying one's expenses or not declaring all of one's taxable income. Of course, a fiddle is also a slang term for violin.There are a couple of proposed derivations of the 'cheating' meaning of the phrase 'on the fiddle', each of them having supporters who are firm in their belief. Let's take the oldest first. The expression is said by some to derive from the Emperor Nero, who famously 'fiddled while Rome burned' and was a byword for corruption and dishonesty. The second suggestion is that the 'fiddle' was the name of the raised edge of the square wooden plates used by sailors. If a sailor took a normal amount of food he was said to have a 'square meal' and if his plate was overflowing he was said to be 'on the fiddle'.As is often the case, I only set up those suggestions in order to knock them down. The Nero story is mere fancy. It may be a nice play on words that he was 'on the fiddle' in both senses, that is, he was both corrupt and a violinist (actually he wasn't even a violinist, there being no such instrument in Nero's lifetime, but let's not get sidetracked) but that's all this tale has going for it.The culinary procedures on board sailing ships don't offer much of an explanation either. The idea that sailors' plates had raised edges and that these were called fiddles is quite incorrect. There were fiddles in sailing ships' galleys but those were arrangements of small posts and strings arranged around the edges of tables that were used to stop plates falling on the floor in rough weather.If the above isn't enough to convince then the fact that 'on the fiddle' in the 'acting fraudulently' meaning is a mid-20th century idiom should clinch it. The expression wasn't known in the age of sail and certainly not in ancient Rome. A good place to look for a phrase like 'on the fiddle', with its association with minor crime, would be court records, and if the expression were in common use in English it might be expected to be found in the database of cases provided by the Central Criminal Court in England and Wales, commonly known as the Old Bailey. This is a comprehensive record of all the criminal cases brought to the court between 1674 and 1913, and no one was accused in The Bailey of being 'on the fiddle' during all that time.The term 'fiddle' appears to have originated in America. It is recorded in an 1874 edition of John Hotten's Slang Dictionary:Fiddle... In America, a swindle or an imposture.Hotten also included this entry:Fiddler... A sharper, a cheat; also one who dawdles over little matters, and neglects great ones.'On the fiddle' was taken up by the British forces in WWII. It was well enough established in popular slang in the UK by 1961 for it to have been used as the title of a Sean Connery film and that is the first example of it that I've found in print. The plot involved a young Connery playing a streetwise rough diamond who runs various street scams while serving in the British army.

A bigger bang for your buckMeaningMore for your money.OriginGenerals and political leaders have argued over the costs of the military since Adam was a lad. Their conversations have probably not changed much:General: "Caesar/My Liege/Mr President, we need more triremes/cannons/nuclear weapons."Emperor/King/President: "The people need more olives/bread/iPads. Can't you manage with what you've got?"Dwight D. Eisenhower faced something of a dilemma in 1953. He was a military man to his socks and was inclined to augment defence in the face of the perceived 'reds under the bed' threat, but he was also a Republican US president and, as such, politically wedded to cutting state spending. His solution was simple - increase the armed forces but decrease their budget. In ordinary circumstances that circle would be difficult to square. The solution that the US Joint Chiefs of Staff came up with, which they titled the 'New Look', was a policy of using nuclear weapons in any conflict bigger than what they called 'a brush-fire war'. That allowed them to radically reduce the numbers of servicemen and replace them with the comparatively inexpensive atomic bombs.All of the above was described in a story in The Winona Republican Herald on 21st December 1953. The story also reports Admiral Arthur Radford as describing the policy as the 'bigger bang for your buck' theory. This was an adaptation of Pepsi-Cola's 'More Bounce to the Ounce' slogan, which was introduced in 1950.Most sources credit US Defense Secretary Charles Wilson as the source of the expression 'a bigger bang for your buck'. These invariably point to him having used the phrase in 1954. Wilson could be the person who coined the phrase but 1954 is clearly too late and, until a pre-December 1953 source is found, the phrase has to be logged as 'coined by Anonymous'.The current form of the phrase, in which the 'bang' has become plural now that it has lost its nuclear connotations, is 'more bangs for your buck'.

Old chestnutMeaningA story that has been told repeatedly before, a 'venerable' joke. Hence, in extended use, anything trite, stale, or too often repeated.OriginThe phrase 'old chestnut' has only an indirect association with chestnut trees or with their fruit. The derivation of the expression turns out to be a contender for old chestnut status itself. The story goes like this: in 1816, a melodrama called Broken Sword, by the playwright and theatrical manager William Dimond, was performed at the Royal Covent Garden Theatre, London. The play contained this exchange:Zavior: I entered the wood at Collares, when suddenly from the thick boughs of a cork tree...Pablo: (Jumping up.) A chesnut, Captain, a chesnut... Captain, this is the twenty-seventh time I have heard you relate this story, and you invariably said, a chesnut, till now.Despite a drubbing from the critics, the play was a success and later transferred to theatres in the USA. So far, so factual.Here's where we move from fact to plausibility. In the 1880s, many American newspapers began using 'chestnut' in the way we do now, to refer to hoary, oft-repeated stories, and the term became established in the common lingo thereafter. The 'old' was added later as an intensifier.In April 1896, the Ohio newspaper The Daily Herald took it unto itself to explain the phrase's origin. It published a story about the actor who had played Pablo in early productions of Broken Sword:William Warren, who had often played the part of Pablo, was at a 'stag' dinner when one of the gentlemen present told a story of doubtful age and originality. 'A chestnut,' murmured Mr. Warren, quoting from the play. 'I have heard you tell the tale these 27 times.' The application of the line pleased the rest of the table, and when the party broke up each helped to spread the story and Mr. Warren’s commentary.The play itself, although popular in its time, was 80 years old by 1896 and Warren was long dead, so the Daily Herald story was (at best) based on Chinese whispers or (at worst) pure invention. However, even if that stag dinner wasn't the first use of the 'chesnut' expression and Warren didn't originate it, someone else could easily have used the same source. The gist of the tale, that 'old chestnut' derives from the play Broken Sword, hovers somewhere between plausibility and fact and many choose to believe it.

Young turkMeaningA young person, full of new ideas and impatient for change.OriginThe figurative expression 'young turks' meaning 'the new breed, impatient for change' began to be used in the early 20th century.William Safire, in The new language of politics: an anecdotal dictionary of catchwords, slogans, and political usage, 1968, referred to a group of US politicians who, in 1929, were called the 'Young Turks':These new Republican warriors were called the Young Turks, a band of about 20 who had mutinied against the feeble leadership of the Old Guard. For Senators they were young men (average age: 56).Safire also included a quotation, which states that Winston Churchill used the phrase during the Bermuda Conference of 1953. Churchill digressed from the agenda to discuss imperialism with Dwight Eisenhower, expressing his doubts about the wisdom of self-government for peoples not yet ready for it. When the American President disagreed with a portion of the Prime Minister's argument, Churchill smiled and said: "You're just like the Young Turks in my government."Neither the US Senate of 1929 nor the British government of 1953 contained anyone of Turkish nationality, so where did the expression come from? It could hardly be simpler. Unusually for a figurative expression the meaning is literal; the first 'young turks' were exactly that - young Turks.Selim III was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1789 to 1807. He made the first major attempts to modernize the army along European lines and to rejuvenate the Turkish empire. These reforms were supported by a band of youthful followers who favoured modernisation but opposed by the more conservative older generation. There are many newspaper reports from around that time that refer to the modernists as 'young Turks' in a purely literal sense, that is, they were young and they were Turkish. For example, this piece from The Salisbury and Winchester Journal, January 1828:The young Turks, of all classes, are exercising themselves in the use of arms in the European manner. The enthusiasm for the Sultan has risen to the highest pitch.This dispute rumbled on for over a century and eventually a Turkish nationalist party that supported the reformation of the absolute monarchy of the Ottoman Empire was formed and started the Turkish revolution of 1908. It was led by The Three Pashas - Mehmed Talaat (aged 34 in 1908), Ismail Enver (27) and Ahmed Djemal (36), who were widely known as the 'Young Turks'. Soon after that and, as we have seen above, as early as 1929, any group of people passionate for change became known as 'young turks'.

Damp squibMeaningSomething that fails ignominiously to satisfy expectations; an anti-climax, a disappointment.OriginThe first thing to say about the expression 'damp squib' is that is is 'squib', not 'squid'. Squid are a species of cephalopod. In their natural environment squid are usually damp but that's as near to this phrase as they are likely to get. Having mentioned squid I ought also to get the other notable squiddish play on words out of the way - the old joke "Hey, where's that sick squid you owe me?". Having done our linguistic duty with squid, we can now move on to 'damp squib'.A squib is a form of firework, usually cylindrical in shape with a paper fuse at one end, which provides a mild explosion - think 'dynamite lite'. Clearly, fireworks work best when they are dry. Anyone who, at a backyard bonfire, has lit the blue touch paper and retired only to see the firework phut and fizzle out will know the disappointment of a damp squib.In the 16th century, 'squibs' were also short, sharp literary compositions of a satirical or sarcastic character. Both the 'firework' meaning and the 'satire' meaning are first found in print in the 1520s and it isn't entirely clear which came first.The first use that I can find of the expression being used figuratively certainly derives from the 'firework' meaning. That is in the London newspaper The Morning Post, March 1837, in a complimentary article about the British parliamentarian George Grote:Mr. Grote is a nice man. We rather like Mr. Grote. Mr. Grote does not vote black white; or fiz and splutter, after the fashion of a damp squib.'Squib' isn't a word that we find ourselves using very often, hence the erroneous 'damp squid' isn't difficult to find in print, for example, this piece from the Trinidad & Tobago Express, June 2005:I imagine the excitement will last for another few weeks before it peters out into a damp squid...

The Real McCoyMeaningThe real thing - not a substitute.OriginThe Scottish racing cyclist Sir Chris Hoy won the sixth Olympic gold medal of his career at the London Games on 7th August 2012, making him the most successful British Olympian and elevating him even higher in the sporting firmament in the UK than he was before. This is far from the first time that Hoy has made news here and the red-top newspapers strained themselves to come up with new headlines - 'Medals Ahoy', 'Hoy Joy', 'Six Machine', 'The Hoy Wonder', 'Knight Rider', and so on. They couldn't do better than the line on the banner that his proud parents unfurl each time he wins - 'The Real McHoy'. This is of course a paraphrase of the expression 'the real McCoy' (or 'real mackay', 'real macoy', 'real mackoy'...), which rivals 'the whole nine yards' and 'the full Monty' for pre-eminence in the 'I know where that phrase comes from' stakes. As usual, plausibility and frequent retelling are considered enough for absolute certainty. With that in mind, please read on...There are several sources that are suggested as being the origin of 'the real McCoy', for example:•McCoy is derived from Mackay, referring to Messrs. Mackay, Edinburgh, who made a brand of fine whisky from 1856 onwards that they promoted as 'the real MacKay' from 1870. The expression could have derived from the name of the branch of the MacKay family from Reay, Scotland, i.e. 'the Reay Mackay'. •After Kid McCoy (Norman Selby, 1872-1940), American welterweight boxing champion. The story goes, and there are various versions of it, that a drunk challenged Selby to prove that he was McCoy and not one of the many lesser boxers trading under the same name. After being knocked to the floor the drunk rose to admit that 'Yes, that's the real McCoy'.•Elijah McCoy, the Canadian inventor educated in Scotland, made a successful machine for lubricating engines that spawned many copies, all inferior to the original. He patented the design in 1872.•The feud between the Hatfield and McCoy families, of West Virginia and Kentucky respectively, in the 1880s.The list goes on to include several other versions but none is supported by any evidence and they carry little credibility. Given that there's no hard evidence, the favourite has to be the earliest example to be found in print. That's a close call, as many of the sources date back to the second half of the 19th century. The earliest known printed citation is from 1856, in the Scottish poem Deil's Hallowe'en:"A drappie o' [drop of] the real McKay."This clearly refers to the McKay (or MacKay) whisky. The 'real MacKay' expression occurs in Scottish newspapers quite frequently in the 1860s and must have been in common use in Scotland at that date. There's no proof (no pun intended) that MacKay's whisky is the source of this phrase but we can say for sure that Elijah McCoy, Kid McCoy and the Hatfields and McCoys weren't involved in its coinage as their respective supposed involvements all come years after the expression was already widely used in print.The 'Real McCoy' variant, which is essentially the same phrase, comes later and the earliest examples that I have found come from Canada. James S. Bond's novel The Rise and Fall of the Union Club, 1881, contains this:By jingo! yes; so it will be. It's the 'real McCoy,' as Jim Hicks says. Nobody but a devil can find us there.A December 1891 edition of the Canadian newspaper The Winnipeg Free Press also includes the expression. Given that Elijah McCoy and the phrase 'the real MacKay' both moved from Scotland to Canada, it is possible that the adaption from 'real MacKay' to 'real McCoy' was done by him or on his behalf, but the real 'real MacKay', like the 'real McHoy', is Scottish.

Be enthralledMeaningTo be captivated; to be held spellbound by pleasing qualities.OriginWho was the first person to be found enthralling? Strange as it may seem for such a destructive and belligerent race, it was a Viking. The Vikings were stalwart ravagers and pillagers but didn't put much effort into housework. They didn't need to; they had the Thralls.The Thralls weren't a race as such but a category of people who were at the absolute bottom of the pile in Scandinavian society in the Dark Ages. They were captives of war who were held as slaves, often passing their bondage on to their children. The harshness of the treatment of the Thralls by the Vikings was uncompromising. Thralls weren't allowed to speak in the presence of their masters nor to own property. Anyone captured by the Vikings was said to be 'in thrall' (later enthrall) and was in for a very bad time indeed.Things didn't get much better for the Thralls when Viking dominance faded around 1100 AD. The Catholic Church decreed that enslavement of Christians was sinful, whereas heathens were fair game. This brought about an increase in demand for non-Christian slaves and the Thralls, being mostly Pagans, continued in slavery. The Lindisfarne Gospels, circa 950 AD, makes a mention (in Old English) of a Thrall in the context of 'one whose liberty is forfeit'.By the 17th century the literal meaning of 'enthrall' had been forgotten and the word began to be used in the way we use it now. Shakespeare used it that way in A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1600:So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.Many Norse words have retained their original negative meanings in modern English - anger, berserk, Hell, irksome, rotten, ugly and troll, for eaxample. It is odd that 'enthralled', a word now associated with pleasure and charm, meant virtually the opposite when it was coined a thousand years ago.

MeaningBecome agitated or angry.OriginIt is often reported that 'it gets my dandruff up' is one of Samuel Goldwyn's celebrated Goldwynisms. When it comes to having aphorisms that he didn't coin attributed to him, Goldwyn is up there in the big league with Oscar Wildeand Yogi Berra. Whether he made that quip is open to doubt. What is clear is that, like those other supposed Goldwyn coinages - 'statue of limitations' and 'stiff upper chin', the 'dandruff' alternative is repeated now for its comic effect. Dander is an informal term for the skin that is shed from the bodies of animals - dandruff in fact. So, perhaps the Goldwynism may not be all that far from the mark.If 'get one's dander up' is synonymous with 'get one's dandruff up' we need to explain how dandruff can be 'up' exactly - not an intuitive picture to visualise. The earlier phrase 'get one's hackles up', which has the same meaning as 'get one's dander up', may help. Hackles are the hairs on the back of the neck, especially of foxhounds when excited by an imminent kill, but is also applied more generally. As dandruff may be attached to hair, it is possible that 'get one's dander up' derived as a jokey alternative to the 'hackles' version.As is often the case with the etymology of old phrases, there's another possible derivation. 'Dander', also means 'ferment', that is, the froth created in the fermentation of yeast in brewing or baking. The word may have been borrowed to form the expression 'get one's dander up' in order to convey the imagery of a frothing or agitated uproar - similar to the associated phrase 'get oneself into a stew'.There's also a speculation that the phrase was originally 'get one's dandruff up' and that it followed the imagery of a violent and agitated scuffle in which the participant's dandruff might be expected to fly into the air. That one is easily dismissed as the 'dandruff' version post-dates the others. The earliest citation I can find for that version is in The Wisconsin Tribune, April 1853:"Well, gosh-all Jerusalem, what of it?' now yelled the downeaster, getting his dandruff up."As we shall see, the 'dander' version is earlier than that.So, 'get one's dander up' derives from either dander meaning hackles or dander meaning ferment. Both are plausible. Dander did certainly have the meaning of ferment by the time the phrase was coined, as recorded in Sir John Dalrymple's Observations on his Yeast-cake, circa 1796:"The season for working molasses lasts five months, of which three weeks are lost in making up the dander, that is, the ferment."Likewise, the 'hackles' meaning was coined at around the same date, as is seen in this entry in the 1786 edition of The Sportsman's Dictionary:"Some horses have neither scales, dander, or scabs."The first reference that I can find to 'dander' being 'up' (or raised), that is, being used with the meaning of excitement or annoyance, is from an story in the 1831 edition of The American Comic Annual, by Henry J. Finn, in which a character is teased for his small stature:" A general roar of laughter brought Timmy on his legs. His dander was raised... straining up to his full height"It would be nice to provide a clear assurance as to the origin of the phrase but, frankly, both meanings of dander have a reasonable claim and your guess is as good as mine. One thing I can say with certainty is that Samuel Goldwyn didn't coin 'get my dandruff up'.

On tenterhooksMeaningIn a state of uncomfortable suspense.OriginTenterhooks aren't directly connected with tents, nor are they the hooks used by butchers, as the common misspelling 'tenderhooks' might suggest. A tenter is a wooden frame, often in the form of a line of fencing, used to hang woollen or linen cloth to prevent it from shrinking as it dries. The tenterhooks are, not surprisingly, the hooks on the tenter used to hold the cloth in place.Tenters are no longer everyday objects but a hundred years ago, in wool weaving areas like the North of England, they were a common sight on the land around the many woollen mills, called 'tenter-fields'. It is easy to see how the figurative expression 'on tenterhooks', with its meaning of painful tension, derived from the 'tenting' or stretching of fabric. The expression was originally 'on the tenters'. The English West Country playright John Ford was the first to record that expression in the play Broken Heart, 1633:Passion, O, be contained. My very heart strings Are on the Tenters.Towards the end of the century the more accurate 'on the tenterhooks' began to replace the earlier phrase. This first example that I have found of it in print is in the 1690 edition of a periodical that was published annually between 1688 and 1693, The General History of Europe:The mischief is, they will not meet again these two years, so that all business must hang upon the tenterhooks till then.

Fine words butter no parsnipsMeaningNothing is achieved by empty words or flattery.OriginThis proverbial saying is English and dates from the 17th century. It expresses the notion that fine words count for nothing and that action means more than flattery or promises. You aren't very likely to come across 'fine words butter no parsnips' as 20th century street slang - you are more liable to hear it in a period costume drama.Potatoes were imported into Britain from America by John Hawkins in the mid 16th century and became a staple in what established itself as the national dish - meat and two veg. Before that, various root vegetables were eaten instead, often mashed and, as anyone who has eaten mashed swedes, turnips or parsnips can testify, they cry out to be 'buttered-up' - another term for flattery. Indeed, the English were known for their habit of layering on butter to all manner of foods, much to the disgust of the French who used it as evidence of the English lack of expertise regarding cuisine and to the Japanese, who referred to Europeans in general and the English in particular as 'butter-stinkers'. This butter habit is evidenced in the various forms of the expression that are found in print in the 1600s - 'fine/fair/soft words butter no parsnips/cabbage/fish/connie[rabbit]'. A typical example is this verse from John Taylor's Epigrammes, 1651:Words are but wind that do from men proceed;None but Chamelions on bare Air can feed;Great men large hopeful promises may utter;But words did never Fish or Parsnips butter..The earliest version that I know of in print is in John Clarke's Latin/English textbookParoemiologia, 1639:Faire words butter noe parsnips, verba non alunt familiam. [words, no family support]

MeaningShowy, but of poor quality.OriginWhy should the derivation of a single word like 'tawdry' be listed on a site that specialises in the etymology of phrases? Two reasons: one, it is short for the phrase 'tawdry lace' (of which more later) and another, I like the derivation so decided to sneak it in.For the explanation of the word tawdry we have to go back to 7th century England and the story of Etheldrida, the daughter of the king of East Anglia, who was otherwise known as Saint Audrey. Audrey died in 679 AD of a tumour of the throat. It was recorded by the Venerable Bede in Ecclesiasticall History, 731 AD, that her fate was considered just retribution as she had "for vain show adorned her neck with manifold splendid necklaces".In the 16th century Nicholas Harpsfield, the Archdeacon of Canterbury, published his own ecclesiastical history Historia Anglicana Ecclesiastica and commented that:"Our women of England are wont to wear about the neck a certain necklace, formed of thin and fine silk."These silks were known as Saint Audrey's laces.As time went by, 'St. Audrey's lace' became shortened to 'taudrey lace'. That comes as little surprise to those of us who live in Yorkshire, where expressions like 'the other' and 'down the hole' have long been replaced by 't'other' and 'down t'ole'. In his 1579 poem The Shepheardes Calendar, Edmund Spenser referred to 'tawdrie lace', in a warning to shepherd's daughters:See, that your rudenesse doe not you disgrace: Binde your fillets faste, And gird in your waste, For more finesse with a tawdrie lace.'Tawdry' hadn't by that date developed the 'showy/poor quality' meaning that we now use but had started on its route there. What began as a name for fine lace ribbon became a disparaging term for the poor quality lace bought by country wenches at rural fairs. When Shakespeare wanted to establish Mopsa, the country bumpkin girlfriend of the Clown in A Winter's Tale, as less than sophisticated, he portrayed her as interested in frivolous showy dress and gave her this line:Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace and a pair of sweet gloves.'Tawdry' has long departed from any association with saints or expensive necklaces and is now entirely a negative description. To all the Audrey's out there, sorry but, as they would say around here, you're just t'Audrey.

Batten down the hatchesMeaningPrepare for trouble.OriginIn his recent (September 2012) song Tempest, which recounts the story of the Titanic's sinking, Bob Dylan uses the lines:They battened down the hatchesBut the hatches wouldn't holdThis has caused a couple of correspondents to write to me asking what 'batten down' means. Many people may know what 'batten down the hatches' means, but some clearly don't, so here goes...'Hatch' is one of those words with dozens of meanings in the dictionary. In this case we are looking at the 'opening in the deck of a ship' meaning. Ships' hatches, more formally called hatchways, were commonplace on sailing ships and were normally either open or covered with a wooden grating to allow for ventilation of the lower decks. When bad weather was imminent, the hatches were covered with tarpaulin and the covering was edged with wooden strips, known as battens, to prevent it from blowing off. Not surprisingly, sailors called this 'battening down'.The misspellings 'battern down the hatches' and 'baton down the hatches' are sometimes found in print. 'Batons' are sticks or staffs, which makes that particular misspelling plausible. 'Batterns' are a form of stage lighting.The earliest reference to this practice that I know of is in William Falconer's An Universal Dictionary of the Marine, 1769:The battens serve to confine the edges of the tarpaulings close down to the sides of the hatches.The first citation of the explicit use of the phrase 'batten down the hatches' is from the 1883 Chambers Journal:"Batten down the hatches - quick, men."

Slush fundMeaningMoney put aside to be used to bribe or influence, especially in a political context.OriginThe word 'slush' was coined in 17th century England as the name for half-melted snow and is first referred to in print with that meaning in Henry Best's Rural Economy in Yorkshire, 1641. Of course, that's where the nameSlushies, the part-frozen flavoured drinks, came from.A century later, there was an alternative meaning of 'slush', or 'slosh', which was the fat or grease obtained from meat boiled on board ship. That invaluable guide The Gentleman's Magazine, 1756, referred to it like this:He used much slush (the rancid fat of pork) among his victuals.William Thompson made it sound even less appetising in The Royal Navy-men's Advocate, 1757:Tars whose Stomachs are not very squeamish, can bear to paddle their Fingers in stinking Slush.Despite it not being the apex of culinary delight it was considered a perk for ships' cooks and crew and they sold the fat that they gathered from cooking meat whenever they reached port. This perquisite became known as a 'slush fund' and the term joins the numerous English phrases that first saw the light of day at sea.The author William McNally didn't think much of the practice and included a description of it in Evils & Abuses in Naval & Merchant Service, 1839:The sailors in the navy are allowed salt beef. From this provision, when cooked nearly all the fat boils off; this is carefully skimmed and put into empty beef or pork barrels, and sold, and the money so received is called the slush fund.In the same year, The Army and Navy Chronicle suggested that a ship's slush fund would be a suitable source of money to buy books for the crew:To give men the use of such books as would best suit their taste, would be to appropriate what is their own, (viz.) the slush fund for the purchase of such works.This is the beginning of the meaning we now have for 'slush fund', i.e. money put aside to make use of when required. The use of such savings for improper uses like bribes or the purchase of influence began in the USA not long afterwards. The Congressional Record for January 1894 printed this:[Cleveland] was not elected in 1888 because of pious John Wanamaker and his $400,000 of campaign slush funds.Into the 20th century and we head straight for one of The Simpsons' many cultural references and back to the original meaning of 'slush fund'. In the 1998 episode Lard of the Dance, Homer and Bart instigate a scheme to make money by collecting and selling grease. They try to siphon Groundskeeper Willie's stashed vat of rancid fat from the school kitchen. A fight breaks out over what is clearly Willie's slush fund or, in 20th century cartoon parlance, his 'retirement grease'.

Worse for wearMeaningShabby or worn through use; drunk.OriginThe expression 'worse for wear' is something of a linguistic oddity in that it has endured a variety of different meanings, versions and spellings during its lifetime. Let's start with the spelling indignities. 'Worse for wear' or 'worst for wear'? Both of these are found in print but, of course, the phrase is 'worse for wear', the alternative being a simple but sadly commonplace muddling of 'worse' and 'worst'. 'Worse for ware' and 'worse for where' are also sometimes seen, again occasionally using 'worst' rather than 'worse', and there's little better explanation for them other than that some people can't spell 'wear'.Anyone familiar with etymology will have come across the redoubtable John Heywood's glossary A Dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of all the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue. 'Worse for wear' is one of the older phrases in the language and Heywood included it in the book's first edition in 1546:Al thyng is the wors for the wearyng.The meaning there is clear - 'as things are used they deteriorate'. As it became established in the language 'worse for wear' developed into a synonym for 'worn out'. At this stage the variant 'none the worse for wear' was coined, meaning 'used but not worn out' and also dragging along its misspelled 'worst/ware/where' versions. The English poet Charles Churchill used that expression, in a rather backhand compliment to his wife, in the poem The Ghost, 1794:Some, in my place, to gain their ends,Would give relations up and friends;Would lend a wife, who, they might swearSafely, was none the worse for wear.Into the 20th century and the phrase took on another meaning, that is, 'drunk'. This was taken up by the UK tabloid press in the 1960s and has now superseded 'tired and emotional' as the euphemism of choice when describing some young wag falling out of a taxi at 3am.

Badger to deathmore like this......other phrases about:AnimalsConflictDeathMeaningHarass or persecute.OriginThe phrase 'badger to death' alludes to the nocturnal burrowing mammal Meles meles, that is, the badger. At first sight it would seem intuitive that the expression refers to the fate of badgers in badger-baiting, an erstwhile so-called sport in which badgers were pitted against dogs and the protagonists tore each other apart. However, those fights weren't as one-sided as we may now suppose. Badgers were chosen for this entertainment as they are extremely tenacious when cornered and have the ability to bite their prey until their teeth meet. This fact has led to the alternative view that 'badgering to death' originally referred to the fate of the dogs and meant 'killed by a badger'. We aren't ever likely to know which of these derivations is correct, although most etymologists favour the former explanation.'Badgering' has been used as a verb to denote persecution for some time. Francis Grose gave a definition of it in the 1785 edition of his invaluable glossary A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue:Badger, to confound, perplex, or teaze.The first record that I can find of 'badgered to death' in print doesn't refer directly to badgers, nor to fighting dogs, but is a metaphorical reference to theatrical performers. This reference is found in Charles Dibdin's journal of the dramatic arts The By-stander; or, Universal Weekly Expositor, 1790, in which he gives the following advice:It is always worth a manager's while to engage a performer for three years. The first he is a drudge; the second he is a servant of all work; the third badgered to death, and at length dismissed.Badger baiting was made illegal in the UK in 1835 and instances of it are now rare, but it still does go on and prosecutions are occasionally brought. Despite that decline, the phrase has been given a new lease of life in recent years. Many UK dairy farmers claim that badgers, which are carriers of Bovine TB, are responsible for spreading the disease and killing their cattle. Of course, tabloid newspapers usually report TB outbreaks with the headline 'cows are badgered to death'.

Under the thumbMeaningCompletely under someone's control.OriginFew fields of endeavour have as much false etymology associated with them as falconry. 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' derives from hunting with birds of prey and this has seemingly led to a spate of supposed derivations along the same lines. 'Hoodwinked' is said to derive from putting a cloth cap over the eyes of a falcon to calm the bird by simulating nighttime and 'old codger' is said to derive from the carrier of the cadge or cage that held the birds. Neither of these has any basis in fact. We can add to the list 'under the thumb', which was recently presented on the BBC's Alan Titchmarsh Show as originating from the handler's use of his thumb to trap the bird in his hand when he didn't want it to fly. Again, that's pure flight of fancy.Being 'under one's thumb' is just a figurative expression that alludes to being completely under another's control. The allusion was to a protagonist so powerful and a victim so insignificant that even the former's thumb was strong enough to control them. None of the early references relates to falconry, or to any other specific origin. The phrase was always used to refer to a powerful person, like a king or lord, exercising control over a subject. The earliest reference I can find to the expression in print is from the 18th century English politician Arthur Maynwaring in The Life and Posthumous Works of Arthur Maynwaring, 1715, which, as is strongly hinted at in the title, was printed after his death:The French King having them under his Thumb, compell'd them to go at his Pace.The phrase was well enough established by the 19th century for it to spawn the verb form 'thumbing'. This was defined in James Halliwell's Dictionary Of Archaic And Provincial Words, 1847, as:Thumbing: A Nottingham phrase, used to describe that species of intimidation practised by masters on their servants when the latter are compelled to vote as their employers please.'Under the thumb' is still used today with much the same meaning as when it was coined in the 18th century. It's not entirely clear what meaning Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had in mind when they wrote the eponymous 'Under My Thumb' in 1966, but it probably wasn't falconry.See also:Under your hatThumbs up

Spring forward, fall back Mnemonic relating to Daylight Saving Time, indicating that clocks are moved forward an hour in spring and back an hour in autumn. Origin Autumn is the time of year for English wrinklies like me to bemoan the creeping Americanization of our culture, as we see Bonfire Night being steadily superseded by Halloween. The 'penny for the guy' of our youth has gone and been replaced by trick or treat and green-faced ghouls at our doors demanding sweets. While finishing off the left-over sweets and transporting myself back to Olde England when reading Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel's excellent novel set in Tudor England, I groaned again at her use of the American 'fall' to mean autumn. It's always advisable to have a stack of reference books nearby when reading the esteemed Hilary's work and I checked the OED nestled inside my iPad. I need not have grumbled; 'fall' is indeed a pukka Tudor word, deriving from the phrase 'fall of the leaf', which is first found in print in Toxophilus, 1545, an archery instruction manual by Queen Elizabeth's tutor Roger Ascham, in which he lists the seasons as: Spring tyme, Somer, faule of the leafe, and winter. This became shortened to 'fall' a century or so later, as in this example in the first known text on forestry, John Evelyn's Sylva, 1664: His [the Oak] leaves becoming yellow at the fall, do commonly clothe it all the winter. 'Fall' travelled to North America with the early settlers and established itself there as the common name for autumn. The word died out in the UK but has begun to re-colonize now due the the take-up of the US expression 'spring forward, fall back' which we all use toward the end of October when, using the old English parlance, 'the clocks go back'. Daylight Saving Time, or Summer Time as it is called in the UK, is a European innovation. Some claims are made for it being an idea that Benjamin Franklin had while staying in Paris. That's not quite correct. Franklin did wake one morning at six o'clock to be surprised to see his room in full sun. He scorned idleness and, in the guise of Poor Richard, was the first to publish the proverb 'early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise'. His industrious mind set to work and calculated that Parisians, by being active in the evening when it was dark and in bed in the morning when it was light, spent 96,075,000 livres tournois [the French currency of the day] more than they need to on candle wax. His suggestion wasn't to change the clocks, he proposed reducing the use of candles. This was to be achieved by: taxing shuttered windows, putting police guards on candle shops, banning the use of carriages after sunset and firing cannons at sunrise. The French in general and Parisians in particular aren't famous for embracing change suggested by foreigners and none of Franklin's improving ideas were taken up. The idea of changing the clocks to provide longer evening sunshine was put forward by the New Zealander George Hudson in 1895 but his notion was never implemented. The first person to carry the idea through to fruition was the London builder William Willett. He wrote the pamphlet,Waste of Daylight in 1907. Daylight Saving Time was, and has remained, a controversial contrivance but Willet's proposal was taken up in England in the First World War and is now used in many countries, especially those in the Northern Hemisphere. England sent the word 'fall' and the idea of Daylight Saving Time to the US and they sent back the phrase 'spring forward, fall back'. The first example of it that I can find in print is in an article by Walter Winchell in an October 1957 edition of the Pennsylvania newspaper The Derrick, who credits the coining to a rival newspaper: New Yorkers and other easterners who enjoy Daylight Savings Time until October’s end are recommended to the Los Angeles Examiner’s clever and simple four-word memo to put the clock ahead or back..."Spring forward, Fall back.

The toast of the town A person who is widely admired. Origin As we know, toast is browned bread. People began eating toast, or at least they began writing about it, in the 15th century. The first reference to it in print is in a recipe for a ghastly sounding concoction called Oyle Soppys (flavoured onions stewed in a gallon of stale beer and a pint of oil) that dates from 1430. Toast wasn't part of the recipe as such; the instructions were to serve the oyle soppys as "hote as tostes". Actually, to say that our mediaeval ancestors ate toast isn't quite correct. Like the batter on fried fish and the pastry on Cornish pasties, which were originally just casings that were thrown away, toast was discarded rather than eaten after it was used as a flavouring for drinks. Lodowick Lloyd's text The Pilgrimage of Princes, 1573, describes this: Alphonsus tooke a toaste out of his cuppe, and cast it to the Dogge. As well as being a flavouring, toast was used to warm drinks and most of the early citations refer to toast being warm or hot. One of our oldest proverbs, as listed in John Heywood's invaluable A dialogue conteinyng the nomber in effect of all the prouerbes in the Englishe tongue, 1546, gives toast as a synonym for hotness: Love had appeerd in hym to her alwase Hotte as a toste. Even as late as the 17th century people didn't eat toast but put it into drinks. Shakespeare gave this line to Falstaff in The Merry Wives of Windsor, 1616: Go, fetch me a quart of Sacke, put a tost in 't. [In Shakespeare's day, as now, sack was fortified wine similar to sherry, so a quart seems a generous measure even for the notorious trencherman Sir John Falstaff.] It isn't difficult to imagine the scene in which some 18th century culinary innovator, having a piece of toast and a drink served together, decided to eat the toast rather than submerging it. Jonathan Swift appears to be the first to have recorded this novelty in print in the poemPanegyrick on Dean, 1735: Sweeten your Tea, and watch your Toast. As to the phrase 'the toast of the town', this came about at the exclusively male drinking clubs of the early 18th century. The 'toast' was the woman who was regarded as the reigning belle of the season. The chaps were invited to flavour and heat their wine with hot spiced toasts and drink to 'the toast of the town'. The English Poet Laureate Colley Cibber wrote about 'toasting' in the comic play Careless Husband, 1705: Ay, Madam, it has been your Life's whole Pride of late to be the Common Toast of every Publick Table. Later in the 1700s it became the norm for any celebrated person, male or female, to be applauded by a toast. Coming more up to date the term toast has taken a 180 degree change of direction. To 'be toast' is now hardly a state to be desired. The usage 'you're toast' = 'you're as good as dead' derives from the 1984 film Ghostbusters. The scriptwriters wrote the line 'I'm gonna turn this guy into toast' but what Bill Murray, in his role as Dr. Peter Venkman, said was "This chick is toast". It is quite likely that the expression was US street slang that was taken up by the Ghostbusters' writers, but the film is what propelled it into the popular consciousness.

Gussied upSmartened up, in a showy or garish way.OriginIf you were to tell anyone in the UK that they were 'gussied up' you would probably get back a blank stare - the term is little known there. In the USA you might get a less welcome response, as it is at best a back-handed compliment, referring as it does to a somewhat lurid 'trying too hard' appearance.It would be nice at this juncture to be able to point to some grande dame famous for her kitsch apparel who was the source of the expression. Sadly, the plot is thicker than that and this phrase's origin is uncertain. There are some clues though, so I'll itemize the evidence and leave you to make what you can of it.First, the word 'gussie'. This was first used in Australia in the early 20th century as a name for a foppish dandy. The Australian feminist novelist Miles Franklin used it in her best-known work My Brilliant Career, 1901, to describe a soppy Lothario to whom she gives the unambiguous but mocking name of Everard Grey:"I'll show him [Everard] I think no more of him than of the caterpillars on the old tree there. I'm not a booby that will fall in love with every gussie I see. I hate and detest men!"'Gussie' was a contraction of the name Augustus, which was the generic name for Roman emperors. In some contexts the name might conjure up thoughts of imperial grandeur, but not so here. It wouldn't have been a name commonly given to horny-handed Australian cobbers and 'gussie' was clearly meant to denote effeminacy, just as 'jessie' does now in Australia and the UK. The New Zealand lexicographer Sidney Baker helpfully removes the need for speculation by defining the word in the Popular Dictionary of Australian Slang, 1941:Gussie, an effeminate or affected man.'Gussie' is also found in US publications, from a slightly later date, with the same meaning.Onward, to 'gussie up'. This appears to be of American origin and, as I've mentioned, has largely stayed in the US. The first example that I can find of it in print is in the July 1945 edition of The Rotarian magazine:The sky is a giddy blue, gussied up with flounces of billowy white clouds.How, why, or even if 'gussied up' evolved from 'gussie' we don't now know. It could be as simple as the expression just derived as meaning 'dressed like an effeminate man'.Also playing a part in this is the US tennis player Gertrude Augusta "Gussie" Moran. Known as Gorgeous Gussie, she was a top player in the late 1940s but, after appearing at Wimbledon and other tournaments in frilly knickers, she is now better remembered for her underwear than her overarm. She wasn't the source of the phrase but if anyone could be said to have 'gussied up' the previously staid tennis uniform it was she and the correspondence of her name and appearance without doubt brought the expression into wider use.

An arm and a legmore like this......other phrases about:Parts of the bodyMeaningA large, possibly exorbitant, amount of money.Origin'It cost and arm and a leg' is one of those phrases that rank high in the 'I know where that comes from' stories told at the local pub. In this case the tale is that portrait painters used to charge more for larger paintings and that a head and shoulders painting was the cheapest option, followed in price by one which included arms and finally the top of the range 'legs and all' portrait. As so often with popular etymologies, there's no truth in that story. Painters certainly did charge more for large pictures, but there's no evidence to suggest they did so by limb count. In any case the phrase is much more recent than the painting origin would suggest.It is in fact an American phrase, coined sometime after WWII. The earliest citation I can find is from The Long Beach Independent, December 1949:Food Editor Beulah Karney has more than 10 ideas for the homemaker who wants to say "Merry Christmas" and not have it cost her an arm and a leg.'Arm' and 'leg' are used as examples of items that no one would consider selling other than at an enormous price. It is a grim reality that, around that time, there were many US newspaper reports of servicemen who had lost an arm and a leg in the recent war. It is possible that the phrase originated in reference to the high cost paid by those who suffered such amputations.A more likely explanation is that the expression derived from two earlier phrases: 'I would give my right arm for...' and '[Even] if it takes a leg', which were both coined in the 19th century. The earliest example that I can find of the former in print is from an 1849 edition of Sharpe's London Journal:He felt as if he could gladly give his right arm to be cut off if it would make him, at once, old enough to go and earn money instead of Lizzy.The second phrase is American and an early example of it is given in this heartfelt story from the Iowa newspaper the Burlington Daily Hawk-Eye, July 1875:A man who owes five years subscription to the Gazette is trying to stop his paper without paying up, and the editor is going to grab that back pay if it takes a leg.

That's all she wrote An articulation of a sudden and unforeseen end to one's hopes or plans. Origin This is very much an American expression so let's begin with a clarification for readers in the UK where it isn't in common use. The phrase is used to convey the meaning of 'it's all over; there's no more to be said'. When seeking the expression's origin it would help to know who 'she' was and what exactly it was that she wrote. As we shall see, and as so often with etymology, that's not entirely clear. The popular version of the origin of this expression is that it is the punch line of a mournful tale about an American GI serving overseas in WWII. The said sad serviceman is supposed to have received a letter from his sweetheart. He reads it to his colleagues: "Dear John". Well, go on, they say. "That's it; that's all she wrote". The story is plausible; 'Dear John' was the standard cipher amongst the US military for the kind of letter that has now been replaced by a 'you're so dumped' text message. The 'Dear John' usage came into being at about the time of WWII. There are several references in 1940s newspapers to 'Dear John' letters that were sent by Franklin Roosevelt, who is sometimes credited with originating the term. These appear to be red herrings in the search for the origin of the phrase and merely allude to letters that FDR sent to prominent public figures who happened to be called John - John Lord O'Brian and John Maynard Keynes for example. The earliest example I can find that refers to 'Dear John' letters with the commonplace meaning is from the Florida newspaper the St. Petersburg Times, March, 1944: The things that brought tears to their eyes included... the downcast GI about whom another told them "He just got a Dear John letter." Those citations give us an approximate date for the emergence of the expression but not the actual source. We may choose to believe the tale about the GI whose letter consisted of just "Dear John" but there's no evidence of any sort to support it. A more likely derivation is a country music song entitled 'That's All She Wrote', recorded by Ernest Tubb and published in sheet music form in 1942: I got a letter from my mama, just a line or two She said listen daddy your good girl's leavin' you That's all she wrote - didn't write no more She'd left the gloom a hanging round my front door. [If you want to hear it, and it is a classic of the country music genre, follow this link to YouTube.] Tubb may have picked up the expression from popular usage but there aren't any examples of it from before 1942 and his version makes no reference to the military setting. Another explanation, and this seems very likely, is that GIs heard the Tubb song on the radio and adapted it to their circumstances. That's All Folks!

'Silly' phrasesPhrases that contain the word 'silly'I have been watching the 30th cricket Test series between England and India and musing about the oddly named field positions 'Silly mid-on', 'Silly point' etc. I've watched enough cricket to know that these are positions close to the batsman, but wondered why they are labelled 'silly' and whether there might be an archaic 'near to' meaning of the word. As it turns out, there isn't. 'Silly' in this context means what we normally mean by the word, that is, 'foolish or empty-headed'. Anyone who has been hit on the knee (or elsewhere) by a cricket ball will understand that standing about six feet away from the batsman is just plain silly.'Silly' may never have meant 'near to' but it did take something of a journey to get to its present meaning. In the 15th century, when the word first began to be used in Middle English it meant 'deserving of pity, compassion, or sympathy'. A 'sylyman' wasn't stupid, just unfortunate. Into the 16th century and into modern English and the meaning migrated to mean 'weak, feeble, insignificant'. The naturalist John Maplet, in the natural history A Greene Forest, 1567, referred to a hedgerow bird like a sparrow as:A smal sillie BirdLater that century 'silly' began to be used with its current meaning. In the English/Italian dictionary Worlde of Wordes, 1598, the Italian linguist John Florio described the Italian word for idiot as:A sillie Iohn [man], a gull, a noddie.I'm not sure what it says about us but there is a large number of words in English that denote stupidity. 'Silly', perhaps because it conveys a form of good-humoured foolishness, appears to be a particular favourite amongst the coiners of phrases. Here are a few, with their derivations:Silly SeasonThe months of August and September, when newspapers make up for the lack of real news by publishing articles on trivial topics. This expression is older than one might think. The US magazine The Saturday Review was amongst the first to make use of it, in July 1861:We have, however, observed this year very strong symptoms of the Silly Season of 1861 setting in a month or two before its time.Ask a silly question...... and you will get a silly answer, of course. This appears to be an American phrase. The first mention that I can find of it in print is from the Minnesota newspaper The Brainerd Daily Dispatch, Tuesday, April, 1945:If you want to ask a silly question and get a silly answer, just ask Mona Roth whom she refers to as El Dorado.If any US readers can help me out as to who Mona Roth was or what that citation is all about, please do.Play silly b***ers[Note: I've blanked out the word above, otherwise many ISP's email filters, careful of your welfare, wouldn't deliver this message.]The esteemed lexicographer Eric Partridge both defined and dated this British slang expression in the 1961 edition of the Dictionary of Slang:Silly b***ers, play, to indulge in provocative horse-play; hence, to feign stupidity: low: since ca. 1920.As is usually the case with Partridge, he gives no supporting evidence for the date and I can't find any actual examples of the phrase in print before the 1960s, even in its bowdlerised form of 'play silly beggers'.Silly BillyIt isn't often the case that a name used in a phrase refers to a real person, but this one does. Silly Billy was the 18th century nobleman Prince William Frederick, the second Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh. The diarist Joseph Romilly wrote of him in Romilly's Cambridge Diary, 1834:He was in a towering passion for a minute but soon got into a good humour by laughing at the D. of Gloster. "Did you see silly Billy squirted on last night? it was worth £5."What the Duke did to earn the nickname I'm not entirely sure, although we can get a glimpse of his character from a line in his biography - "He was an enthusiastic and brave, if not terribly professional, soldier... renowned for his lack of intelligence". Appearances can be deceptive but in all the paintings of him the eponymous Duke doesn't look to be the sharpest knife in the box. It would be fitting if the squirting referred to in the above quote was done with Silly String. Sadly not, that was patented in the USA 1970.

Necessity is the mother of invention Meaning Difficult situations inspire ingenious solutions. Origin The author of this proverbial saying isn't known. It is sometimes ascribed to Plato, but no version of it can be found (by me at least) in his works. It was known in England by the 16th century, although at that point it must have been known to very few as it was then documented in its Latin form rather than in English. Many well-known proverbs appeared first in Latin and were transcribed into English by Erasmus and others, often as training texts for latin scholars. William Horman, the headmaster of Winchester and Eton, included the Latin form 'Mater artium necessitas' inVulgaria, a book of aphorisms for the boys of the schools to learn by heart, which he published in 1519. Roger Ascham came close to an English version of the phrase in his manual on how to use a longbow, which is by the way the first book ever written about archery, Toxophilus, 1545: "Necessitie, the inuentour of all goodnesse." George Chapman also had a 'close but no cigar' moment with his tragic play The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron, 1608: "The great Mother, Of all productions (grave Necessity)." The earliest actual usage of 'necessity is the mother of invention' that I can find in print is in Richard Franck's 'Northern Memoirs, calculated for the meridian of Scotland'. Originals of this text are difficult to locate, but it was republished in 1821, with a foreword by Sir Walter Scott. The frontispiece of the reprint states that the original was "writ in the year 1658". It contains this: Art imitates Nature, and Necessity is the Mother of Invention. 1658 seems the best date we have as the birth of the phrase in English. Frank Zappa gave this phrase an extra lease of life when he chose the name of his inventive jazz/rock band in 1964 - The Mothers of Invention. His use of 'mothers' clearly had a ribald meaning that Erasmus wouldn't have approved of but Zappa did at least keep the expression from dropping into 'granny phrase' obscurity.

Union JackMeaningThe popular name of the national flag of the United Kingdom.OriginTwo subjects that arouse passion more than most are language and national identity and here in the UK these collide at the name of the national flag. Spare a thought for my welfare as I wade gingerly into a muddy pond teeming with crocodiles with a particular taste for etymologists.What's the flag called? It's the Union Jack of course. Pause for an intake of breath amongst purists; "No, it's the Union Flag!".Whether you prefer 'flag' or 'jack', most agree on the union part of the name. I say 'most' as even calling the place I live the United Kingdom will raise some hackles. I often get mail along the lines of "You live in England! England, geddit, not the UKay!".Nevertheless, let's press on and try to explain the oddly named standard, the Union Jack. The 'union' part is straightforward. The flag originated as a visual representation of the various political unions of the countries that formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northen Ireland, the present design being established in 1801.(An aside for those who aren't quite sure what Great Britain is. Britain is the little green island to the north of France, originally called 'great' to distinguish it from what is now called Brittany, which was in the Middle Ages also called Britain. Brittany is now sometimes called Little Britain, which can be confusing as the popular TV show, Little Britain was about Great Britain not Brittany ...and this little tangent was supposed to clarify things. Let's get back to the plot.)The flag was formed by photoshopping the crosses of the patron saints of England, Scotland and Ireland - St. George, St. Andrew and St. Patrick. Wales was already a principality of England by this point so didn't get visual respresentation on the flag.So, that's 'Union'. Now to the tricky part - 'jack' or 'flag'. To be quite proper about it, it's the Union Flag. However, both Union Flag and Union Jack are widely accepted and referring to the flag as the Union Jack has the advantage that everyone around the world will know what you are talking about. The 'jack' designation came about when the national flag was flown from the 'jack-staff' of sailing ships. The jack-staff is a spar on the bow of a sailing ship and purists will say that the only time that the flag should be called the Union Jack is when it is flown from a ship's jack-staff. If you like you can opt for uber-pedantry and call it the Union Jack Flag.Now, I'd just better check that image of the national flag is the right way up or I'll really be in trouble.

At loggerheadsMeaningIn dispute with.Origin'At loggerheads' is of UK origin. The singular 'loggerhead' occurs as a name in several contexts - as a species of turtle, a bird and as a place name. Originally, a loggerhead was none of these but was first used with the meaning of 'a stupid person - a blockhead'. Shakespeare used it that way in Love's Labours Lost, 1588:"Ah you whoreson logger-head, you were borne to doe me shame."A 'logger-head' was literally a 'block-head'. A logger was a thick block of timber which was fastened to a horse's leg to prevent it from running away. In the 17th century, a loggerhead was also recorded as 'an iron instrument with a long handle used for melting pitch and for heating liquids'. It is likely that the use of these tools as weapons was what was being referred to when rivals were first said to be 'at loggerheads'.The first known use of the phrase in print is in Francis Kirkman's, The English Rogue, 1680:"They frequently quarrell'd about their Sicilian wenches, and indeed... they seem... to be worth the going to Logger-heads for."The next year saw the printing of The Arraignment, Trial, and Condemnation of Stephen Colledge. In that text, the author makes a clear link between loggerheads and fighting: So we went to loggerheads together, I think that was the word, or Fisty-cuffs. Incidentally, 'fisticuffs' is another two-word term from around the same date that was later amalgamated into a single word. A cuff was a blow with the open hand. A fisty cuff was a cuff using the fist, i.e. a punch. Following the departure of the clown William Kemp from The Lord Chamberlain's Men, the troupe of actors that William Shakespeare worked with for most of his writing and acting career, his place was taken by Robert Armin. In 1605, the diminutive clown Armin, a.k.a. 'Snuff, the Clown of the Globe', had a stab at writing and came up with Foole upon Foole. In this piece he makes the first recorded reference to 'fisty cuffs': "The foole... falls at fisty cuffes with him."Loggerheads is also the name of three small towns in the UK - in Leicestershire, in Lancashire and in Mold, North Wales. As is 'de rigueur' when a town might have some reason to claim to be associated with some phrase or another, each town's residents claim that 'at loggerheads' originated in their home-town. Alas, despite the early citations referring to 'going to' loggerheads, this isn't the case. The towns were named after the term, not the other way about. Nevertheless, the use of 'loggerheads' as a place name has been a boon to stand-up comedians of the 'take my wife...' fraternity. They have been trotting out this classic for years:'I'm going on holiday - a fortnight at Loggerheads with the wife'.

Derring-doMeaningHeroic daring. OriginWe now use 'derring-do' as a rather curious and archaic sounding two-part noun to describe 'ye olde' swordplay and the like. Use of the phrase was almost obligatory in any review of films starring the late Errol Flynn, who was surely the most audacious actor ever to swash a buckle. The fact that we come to have the word at all is actually due to a series of mistakes by a group of very eminent writers. The earliest form of 'derring-do' in print is found in Geoffrey Chaucer's Troylus And Criseyde, circa 1374: "In durring don that longeth to a knight."Chaucer was using the two words 'durring' and 'don' with their usual 14th century meanings of 'daring' and 'do'. This line in his work translates into 20th century language as 'in daring to do what is proper for a knight'. The poet John Lydgate, paraphrased Chaucer in The Chronicle of Troy, 1430, and his 'dorryng do' was misprinted in later versions of the work as 'derrynge do'. In reading the above, the celebrated Tudor poet Edmund Spenser appears not to have realised that derrynge was a misprint of durring, the meaning of which he would have been familiar with, and interpreted 'derrynge do' as meaning 'brave actions'. That was the way he used it in several of his late 16th poems, including his best-known work, The Faerie Queene, 1596:"A man of mickle name, Renowned much in armes and derring doe."Last, but not least, make way for that inveterate plunderer of historic language, Sir Walter Scott. His use of 'derring-do' as a single word in the hugely popular novel Ivanhoe, 1820, cemented it into the language: "Singular," he again muttered to himself, "if there be two who can do a deed of such derring-do!"Incidentally, Flynn and his flamboyant colleagues weren't described as swashbuckling for no reason. 'Swash' was a 16th century term that referred to the noise braggarts made to simulate the sound of swishing weapons when pretending to swordfight. A buckler was a small round shield, usually fixed to the forearm. So, a 'swashbuckler' was a swaggering ruffian; someone very likely to swash his buckle.

Wax poetic MeaningSpeak in an increasingly enthusiastic and poetic manner.Origin'Waxing poetic' has nothing to do with bees, candles, or polishing cars. The verb 'to wax' is 'to grow'; the opposite of 'to wane', which is 'to decrease'. Grow and decrease have largely superseded the archaic terms wax and wane in almost all modern usages, apart from the waxing and waning of the moon. The other remaining contemporary uses of 'wax' with the meaning of 'grow', survive in various expressions like 'wax poetic' and 'wax lyrical'. These are often explained as deriving from the imagery of the waxing of the moon. In fact, the word is extremely ancient and was used to mean grow in many contexts prior to it being used to describe the monthly increase in size of the visible moon. King Alfred, in the translation of Pope Gregory's Pastoral Care, which he commissioned in AD 897, used the Old English version of the word - 'weaxan'. There are numerous examples of the use of 'wax', meaning 'grow', in mediaeval texts. For example, The Geneva Bible, 1560:"But he that shulde haue bene vpright, when he waxed fat, spurned with his hele."[the 1611 version has it in more modern English as "Jesurun waxed fat, and kicked."] It isn't until much later that 'wax' began to be used to refer to flowery and poetic speech or writing. This occurs in various phrases, like 'wax lyrical', 'wax poetic' and 'wax eloquent'. Of these, it is 'wax poetic' that is still most commonly used. 'Wax eloquent' was the first of this group of phrases to be used to describe someone becoming increasingly expansive and expressive in speech. That dates from the early 19th century, for example, this piece from Bracebridge Hall, a collection of essays and literary sketches by Washington Irving, 1824:"The whole country is covered with manufacturing towns... a region of fire; reeking with coal-pits, and furnaces, and smelting-houses, vomiting forth flames and smoke." The squire is apt to wax eloquent on such themes.Ironically, far from 'waxing eloquent', Irving was suffering from writer's block in 1824, following a family bereavement, and struggled to finish enough essays as to be worth publishing. 'Waxing poetic' came next. The first example that I can find in print is in Sir Henry Morton Stanley’s How I Found Livingstone, 1872:"One could almost wax poetic, but we will keep such ambitious ideas for a future day."Stanley seems to have been an enthusiastic waxer. His book also contains "I waxed indignant", "Farquhar and Shaw waxed too wroth", "I accordingly waxed courageous" - all at a time when he reports that the sun "waxed hotter and hotter". 'Wax lyrical' followed in the early 20th century; for example, Gilbert Cannan's translation of Jean-Christophe in Paris, 1911:"He had the genius of taste except at certain moments when the Massenet slumbering in the heart of every Frenchman awoke and waxed lyrical."Time for me to wane lyrical and stop.

Back to square oneMeaningBack to the beginning, to start again.OriginThere are three widely reported suggestions as to the origin of this phrase: BBC sports commentaries, board games like snakes and ladders and playground games like hopscotch. Let's examine them in turn: BBC Commentaries:In order that listeners could follow the progress of football games in radio commentaries, the pitch was divided into eight notional squares. Commentators described the play by saying which square the ball was in. The Radio Times, the BBC's listings guide, referred to the practice in an issue from January 1927. Commentaries that used a numbering system certainly happened and prints of the pitch diagrams still exist. Recordings of early commentaries also exist, including the very first broadcast sports commentary (of a rugby match). That commentary, and many others that followed, referred listeners to the printed maps and a second commentator called out the numbers as the ball moved from square to square. However, at no point in any existing commentary do they use the phrase 'back to square one'.Despite this, the BBC issued a piece in a January 2007 edition of The Radio Times that celebrated 80 years of BBC football commentary. In this, the football commentator John Murray stated with confidence that "Radio Times' grids gave us the phrase 'back to square one'" and that "the grid system was dropped in the 1930s (not before the phrase 'back to square one' had entered everyday vocabulary)". This confidence is despite the fact that, although it could be true, it is nothing but conjecture. What is a fact is that the BBC broadcast a more measured view in the popular etymology series Balderdash and Piffle, in collaboration with the OED, in 2006. This questioned the claims that the BBC commentaries were the source of the phrase and that it was in circulation in the 1930s. It's not the first time that BBC commentators have talked balderdash and piffle and I doubt it will be the last. Private Eye made something of a cottage industry out of printing examples of such in their Colemanballs columns and books. (see over the moon).Board Games:Many people report that the phrase refers to Snakes and Ladders or similar board games. The earliest citation of the phrase in print is currently 1952, from the Economic Journal:"He has the problem of maintaining the interest of the reader who is always being sent back to square one in a sort of intellectual game of snakes and ladders."Despite that comment, it isn't a feature of Snakes and Ladders that players are sent back to square one. Of the many examples of such boards that exist, only a few have a snake in the first square. For the phrase to have come from that source people must have had occasion to use it, and that appears not to be the case with Snakes and Ladders. HopscotchThis playground game is played on a grid of numbered squares. The precise rules of the game vary from place to place but usually involves players hopping from square to square, missing out the square containing their thrown stone. They go from one to (usually) eight or ten and then back to square one. The game's name derives from 'scotch', which was used from the 17th century to denote a line scored on the ground and, of course, hopping. It was referred to in the 1677 edition of Robert Winstanley's satirical almanac Poor Robin:"The time when School-boys should play at Scotch-hoppers."All of the above explanations are plausible enough to gain supporters. As is usual with phrases of uncertain origin, most people are happy to believe the first explanation they hear. There's no real evidence to put the origin beyond reasonable doubt, and so it remains uncertain. Whatever the source, 1952 is surprisingly late as the earliest printing for a phrase that was certainly in the spoken language much earlier than that. There are many believable hearsay examples from at least thirty years earlier. Perhaps a printed source from before 1952 will yield the truth? See also: back to the drawing board.

Augur wellMeaningTo foreshadow a successful outcome, indicated by some circumstance or event.OriginAs you might expect of someone who writes this stuff, I like crosswords. A clue that I came across recently was 'Soothsayer with a noisy implement'. Those of you who are familiar with the arcane rules of cryptic crosswords may have deduced that the answer to this is 'augur'. For those of you who aren't crossword aficionados, an augur is a fortune teller and an auger is a carpenter's tool - the 'noisy' keyword usually translates as 'sounds like' and clearly, 'augur' sounds like 'auger'. To be more specific about augers and augurs, an auger is the 'bit' part of a carpenter's brace and bit, i.e. a drill. An augur was a Roman official with the job of predicting the future and advising on public policy. That might sound like a difficult task but, in practice, the augurs just had to look mysterious and feign the experience of receiving omens arising from the flight of birds or the appearance of the entrails of sacrificial victims, etc. - no doubt to the accompaniment of a good deal of toga flapping and rolling of eyes. Of course, 'auguring well' has nothing to do with drilling neat holes but derives from the Roman augur's prediction of a good outcome as the consequence of some portent. Similarly, 'to augur badly' didn't mean 'to make an inaccurate prediction' but 'to predict a bad event'.The phrase 'augur well' isn't a translation from Latin but originated, in the late 18th century, amongst the classically educated English elite. The first record of it that I have found is from a speech to the UK Parliament, given by the Duke of Richmond and published in the Parliamentary Register for 1778:"I augur well from the readiness with which it [his request for papers about the movements of British forces] has been granted."'Augur well' has much in common with 'bode well', which is also of ancient vintage and means much the same thing. A bode was a herald or messenger and was referred to thus as early as circa 888AD in King Alfred's Boethius De consolatione philosophiae. Like 'augur', 'bode' also had to wait until the 18th century to become absorbed into a common phrase. The first known use of 'bode well' comes from John Dryden's Works, circa 1700:"Whatever now The omen proved, it boded well to you."

In the offingMeaningImminent; likely to happen soon.OriginThis is one of the many phrases of nautical origin. It is quite simple to understand once you know that 'the offing' is the part of the sea that can be seen from land, excluding those parts that are near the shore. Early texts also refer to it as 'offen' or 'offin'.Someone who was watching out for a ship to arrive would first see it approaching when it was 'in the offing' and expected to dock before the next tide. Something that is 'in the offing' isn't happening now or even in a minute or two, but will inevitably happen before too long. The phrase has migrated from its naval origin into general use in the language and is now used to describe any event that is imminent.In its literal nautical sense, the phrase has been in use since the late 16th century and the earliest citation of it that I have found is a quotation from S. Argoll from 1610 which was reported by S. Purchas in Purchas his Pilgrimes, in 1906:"I came to an Anchor in seven fathomes water in the offing to sea."The phrase wasn't commonly used until the beginning of the 18th century, as in this example from Josiah Burchett's Memoirs of Transactions at Sea During the War with France, 1703. This is, incidentally, a classic example of the use of the long form of the letter 's' in 18th century printing: ...fome other fmall Ships were feen in the Offing. Thofe Ships ftood away with their Boats a-head, fetting fire to fome, and deftroying and deferting other of their fmall veffels.All of the 18th century citations of 'in the offing' refer to the offing as a physical place. It wasn't until the mid 19th century, in America, that our presently understood figurative meaning began to be used. An early example of that comes in S. B. Beckett's Portland Reference Book and City Directory, 1850:We have known wives to forget that they had husbands when they supposed that a tax bill or a notification to do military duty was in the offing.

MeaningAn affectionate term for wife.OriginUnlike the many vaguely pejorative terms that the English have coined about their near neighbours, e.g. 'Dutch courage', 'Dutch treat', Dutch uncle' etc., 'my old Dutch' has nothing at all to do with the Netherlands. The expression is often cited as an example of Cockney rhyming slang. It is certainly a slang term that originated in London, but it isn't rhyming slang, as Dutch, being short for duchess, is an abbreviation rather than a rhyme. Some commentators have suggested that the expression is true CRS and that 'Dutch' is short for 'Duchess of Fife' and hence a rhyme for 'wife'. This assertion isn't supported by the facts. The term 'Dutch', meaning 'woman of showy appearance' and later an affectionate term for wife, was known by the early 18th century. Oliver Goldsmith referred to it in his comic play She Stoops to Conquer, 1773:"This Stammer in my address... can never permit me to soar above the reach of... one of the Duchesses of Drury-Lane."The name was used specifically to refer to a wife in Donald Mitchell's Jimmy Johnson's Holiday, circa 1883. Mitchell was an American writer who wrote this piece while travelling in England:"Now he'd not a brown [a copper halfpenny], nor a friend in town, In fact he was quite undone; He made a vow he'd never row with his old Dutch again."The granting of titles to the British aristocracy is a subject that is minutely recorded and those records come in handy at this point. The Earl of Fife was created the First Duke of Fife on 27th July 1889, on his marriage to Princess Louise Dagmar, the daughter of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Until that date, there had been no title of Duchess of Fife. It is clear that the phrase came before the title and that 'Duchess of Fife' can't be the source of 'my old Dutch'.The determination of some to establish that the term is Cockney rhyming slang has led to another inventive suggestion - that the term derives from 'Dutch plate', i.e. 'mate'. This is doubly unconvincing as 'Dutch plate' isn't a known 19th century expression and 'my old Dutch' means wife, not mate. It is likely that this supposed derivation has been confused with 'China plate', which is genuine CRS. It was quite soon after Mitchell's publication that the song that made the phrase well-known was popularised by the music-hall entertainer, Albert Chevalier. Chevalier was a popular London-based variety artist of the late Victorian era and was widely known by the abbreviation 'AC'. That's something of a mercy, as his full name was Albert Onésime Britannicus Gwathveoyd Louis Chevalier. The lyrics of My Old Dutch were written by Chevalier in 1893, probably as a tribute to his wife Florrie although, if so, the 'been together now for forty years' line is something of a stretch of artistic license, as the couple didn't marry until October 1894.We've been together now for forty years,An' it don't seem a day too much,There ain't a lady livin' in the landAs I'd swop for my dear old Dutch. The supposed association of 'My old Dutch' with Cockney rhyming slang has been strengthened by the linking of the phrase with Chevalier, who's stage persona was very much the Cockney 'singing costermonger'. Amongst London costermongers, 'dutch' just meant 'duchess' - slang, yes, but rhyming, no. The Duchess of Fife lived a quiet life out of the public gaze, but her position in society made her name well-known. 'Duchess of Fife' did become used as rhyming slang for wife, but that was in the 20th century, long after ''Dutch' and 'my old Dutch' were already well-established.

Ring a ring o'roses, a pocketful of posies, atishoo, atishoo, all fall downMeaningVerse from a nursery rhyme.OriginThere are many versions of this rhyme, some of which use entirely different words to the roses/rosy variants. The most commonly seen are 'ring a ring of (or o') roses (or rosy)' and 'ring around a rosy'. The many versions aren't surprising as, being lines from a playground rhyme, they would have first been spoken/sung/chanted rather than recorded in a book.It is often suggested that the rhyme relates to the symptoms of plague, specifically the Black Death - the bubonic plague that spread through Europe in the 1340s, or to the Great Plague of London, 1665/6. The plausible-sounding theory has it that the 'ring' was the ring of sores around the mouths of plague victims, who subsequently sneezed and fell down dead. Those with more knowledge of etymology will shake their heads sagely and explain that the plague theory is a well-known falsehood. The idea is usually dismissed for these reasons:1. The first appearance of the rhyme in print is in Kate Greenaway's Mother Goose, which wasn't published until 1881, suggesting that the rhyme originated far too late for the Great Plague to have been the origin:Ring-a-ring-a-roses,A pocket full of posies;Hush! hush! hush! hush!We're all tumbled down.2. The 'atishoo, atishoo, all fall down' lyric isn't present in many of the the numerous versions and neither soreness about the mouth nor sneezing tally with the actual symptoms of people suffering from bubonic plague. 3. The noted folklorists of childhood Iona and Peter Opie have reported that the plague theory didn't appear until the 1950s. If the theory were true then we would expect to see it in circulation much sooner than that. Despite the strong evidence against it, some of the refutations of the plague theory are rather too emphatic in their rejection of this idea. Let's look at those items of evidence in turn:Firstly, the 1881 date that is part of the refutations is a little misleading; it is the first known printing of the complete rhyme, but the game and the 'ring a ring of rosies' line were known well before that. The game and the rhyme were known in the USA, and quite probably elsewhere, by 1855, when it was included in The Old Homestead, a novel by Ann S. Stephens. This depicts children playing 'Ring, ring a rosy' in New York.William Wells Newell, the author of Games and Songs of American Children, 1884, wrote that Ring a Ring a Rosie, with the familiar tune, was in use by children in Bedford, Massachusetts, circa 1790. The version he recorded was:Ring a ring a rosieA bottle full of posie,All the girls in our town,Ring for little Josie Newell was a respected folklorist but, unfortunately, he didn't supply documentary evidence for his assertion. The argument that the lyric couldn't have lasted in common playground parlance without being recorded in print from the days of the Black Death in the 1340s until 1881 has some weight. The Black Death wasn't the only occurrence of plague in England - the population also suffered Great Plague of 1665. That 'ring a ring o'roses' lay unrecorded between 1665 and 1790 doesn't seem entirely impossible - many phrases have lain dormant for longer than that. Children's rhymes would have been of little interest to authors in the 17th century and printing was then still an expensive process. There's no evidence to suggest that these lines originated as anything other than a children's rhyme and would inevitably have been known to children for some time before appearing in print. How long a time is open to conjecture, but 125 years - well, why not? Secondly, both coughing, sneezing and bright red sputum are symptoms of pneumonic plague, which has just as good a claim to be the rhyme's origin as does bubonic plague.Thirdly, the Opies only claim that they haven't found evidence of the plague theory from before the 1950s; they don't know when it actually originated. So, the items of evidence against the plague origin of the rhyme are open to doubt. However, showing that something is possible doesn't make it true. It is a common urge to try to ascribe meaning to ambiguous lyrics and poems - for example, 'Pop goes the weasel'. An alternative and more probable explanation, and one which is almost always the case with nursery rhymes, is that the words are playful nonsense.The plague derivation is indeed unlikely but, in their haste to denounce an apparent fallacy, several websites have begged the question by swallowing the assertion that 'the first time the phrase appears in print is 1881' as fact. As a French wine producer once said after tasting a poor imported wine which was labelled 'Appellation d’origine contrôlée'; "the paper never refuses the ink" - that goes double for digital paper.

A stitch in time saves nineMeaningA timely effort will prevent more work later.OriginThis is nothing to do with rips in the fabric of the space-time continuum, as some have ingeniously suggested. The meaning of this proverb is often requested at the Phrase Finder Discussion Forum, so I'll be explicit. The question usually asked is "saves nine what"? The stitch in time is simply the sewing up of a small hole in a piece of material and so saving the need for more stitching at a later date, when the hole has become larger, Clearly, the first users of this expression were referring to saving nine stitches. The Anglo Saxon work ethic is being called on here. Many English proverbs encourage immediate effort as superior to putting things off until later; for example, 'one year's seeds, seven year's weeds', 'procrastination is the thief of time' and 'the early bird catches the worm'. The 'stitch in time' notion has been current in English for a very long time and is first recorded in Thomas Fuller's Gnomologia, Adagies and Proverbs, Wise Sentences and Witty Sayings, Ancient and Modern, Foreign and British, 1732:"A Stitch in Time May save nine."Fuller, who recorded a large number of the early proverbs in the language, wrote a little explanatory preamble to this one:"Because verses are easier got by heart, and stick faster in the memory than prose; and because ordinary people use to be much taken with the clinking of syllables; many of our proverbs are so formed, and very often put into false rhymes; as, a stitch in time, may save nine; many a little will make a mickle. This little artiface, I imagine, was contrived purposely to make the sense abide the longer in the memory, by reason of its oddness and archness."As far as is known, the first person to state unambiguously that 'a stitch in time saves nine', rather than Fuller's less confident 'may save nine', was the English astronomer Francis Baily, in his Journal, written in 1797 and published in 1856 by Augustus De Morgan:After a little while we acquired a method of keeping her [a boat] in the middle of the stream, by watching the moment she began to vary, and thereby verifying the vulgar proverb, '"A stitch in time saves nine."

A skeleton in the closetMeaningA secret source of shame, potentially ruinous if exposed, which a person or family makes efforts to conceal.OriginThe phrase 'a skeleton in the closet' was coined in England in the 19th century. Since then the word closet has become used primarily in England to mean 'water closet', i.e. lavatory - a possible hiding place for a skeleton I suppose, but not one with much potential. The English now usually use 'a skeleton in the cupboard', with 'skeleton in the closet' more common in the USA. 'A skeleton in the closet' undoubtedly originated as an allusion to an apparently irreproachable person or family having a guilty secret waiting to be uncovered. The close-at-hand domestic imagery of a closet or cupboard gives a sense of the ever-present risk of discovery. What isn't clear is whether the origin of the phrase lies in fiction or with real life, so to speak, skeletons. The phrase was first used in the early 1800s. The first reference I can find in print is a figurative one in a piece by William Hendry Stowell, in the UK monthly periodical The Eclectic Review, 1816. The 'skeleton' in this case was the desire to keep a hereditary disease secret: Two great sources of distress are the danger of contagion and the apprehension of hereditary diseases. The dread of being the cause of misery to posterity has prevailed over men to conceal the skeleton in the closet...The dramatic device of a hidden body was used widely in the Gothic novels of the Victorian period. Edgar Allen Poe was the master of such tales, for example, this extract from The Black Cat, 1845 :"Gentlemen, I delight to have allayed your suspicions", and here, through the mere frenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom. The wall fell bodily. The corpse, already greatly decayed, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators. It has been suggested that the phrase derives from the era of the notorious body snatchers, i.e. prior to 1832, when the UK's Anatomy Act allowed the more extensive use of corpses for medical research. The theory goes that, in a scenario like that of the concealment of Catholic priests in priest holes in domestic houses in Elizabethan England, doctors would conceal in cupboards the illegally held skeletons they used for teaching. There's no evidence at all to corroborate that theory. Concealed skeletons are occasionally found walled-up in houses but they are usually those of unwanted infants.The notion of a skeleton in the closet as shorthand for the grim evidence of a murder was widely adopted into the language due to the writings of the popular Victorian author William Makepeace Thackeray. He referred to 'a skeleton in every house' in a piece in 1845 and explicitly to 'skeletons in closets' in The Newcomes; memoirs of a most respectable family, 1854–55:Some particulars regarding the Newcome family, which will show us that they have a skeleton or two in their closets, as well as their neighbours.Whether Thackeray was alluding to actual skeletons or whether he was responding to the imagination of authors like Poe, we are never likely to know. One person he certainly wasn't referring to was the 18th/19th century philosopher Jeremy Bentham - despite his being the best-known actual skeleton in a cupboard. Bentham was hardly aiming to keep his skeleton a secret, as he willed that his body be preserved in a wooden cabinet. It is on public display in University College, London. The American expressions 'come out of the closet' or simply 'come out' began to be used in the 1960s and are, of course, direct follow-ons from 'a skeleton in the closet'. As far as I'm aware, no one in the UK has declared themselves as gay by coming out of a cupboard.

Hobson's choiceMeaningNo real choice at all - the only options being to either accept or refuse the offer that is given to you.OriginThere is a story that 'Hobson's choice' comes from a Mr. Hobson who hired out horses and gave his customers no choice as to which horse they could take. This has all the credentials of a 'folk etymology' myth but, in this case, the derivation is correct. A search of Google will return several thousand hits for 'Hobbesian choice'. The mistaken uses of that phrase, in place of the correct 'Hobson's choice', originate from a confusion between the celebrated philosopher Thomas Hobbes and the obscure Thomas Hobson, to whom the phrase refers. Thomas Hobson (1545–1631) ran a thriving carrier and horse rental business in Cambridge, England, around the turn of the 17th century. Hobson rented out horses, mainly to Cambridge University students, but refused to hire them out other than in the order he chose. The choice his customers were given was 'this or none'; quite literally, Hobson's choice. The phrase was already being described as proverbial less than thirty years after Hobson's death. The Quaker scholar Samuel Fisher referred to the phrase in his religious text, The Rustick's Alarm to the Rabbies, 1660:"If in this Case there be no other (as the Proverb is) then Hobson's choice ... which is, chuse whether you will have this or none."The Spectator, No. 509, 1712, explains how Hobson did business, which shows clearly how the phrase came into being:"He lived in Cambridge, and observing that the Scholars rid hard, his manner was to keep a large Stable of Horses, ... when a Man came for a Horse, he was led into the Stable, where there was great Choice, but he obliged him to take the Horse which stood next to the Stable-Door; so that every Customer was alike well served according."After his death in 1631, Hobson was remembered in verse by no less a figure than John Milton, saying "He had bin an immortall Carrier". That seems rather a strange thing to say just after he had died. Eighty-six was a very good innings in the 17th century, but hardly immortality. The phrase was still well enough known in the 20th century for 'hobsons' to be adopted then as Cockney rhyming slang for 'voice'.The most celebrated application of Hobson's choice in the 20th century was Henry Ford's offer of the Model-T Ford in 'any colour you like, so long as it's black'.

Copper-bottomedMeaningGenuine; trustworthy.OriginIf you come across something that is copper-bottomed these days, it is most likely to be a saucepan. In the 18th century, it would have been a ship. It is unusual for an idiomatic phrase to have such a literal derivation as this. 'Copper-bottomed' described ships that were fitted with copper plating on the underside of their hulls. The process was first used on ships of the British Navy in 1761 to defend their wooden planking against attack by Teredo worms a.k.a. Shipworms (actually a type of bivalve clam) and to reduce infestations by barnacles.The method was successful in protecting ships' timbers and in increasing speed and manoeuvrability and soon became widely used. This piece from The London Magazine, March 1781, records the introduction of its use on all the ships of the Royal Navy:Admiral Keppel made a remark upon copper bottomed ships. He said they gave additional strength to the navy and he reproached Lord Sandwich with having refused to sheath only a few ships with copper at his request, when he had since ordered the whole navy to be sheathed.John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, may have been otherwise occupied. He is said to have once spent twenty-four hours at the gaming-table without refreshment other than some cold beef placed between slices of toast - hence giving name to the sandwich. Before long, 'copper-bottomed' began to be used figuratively to refer to anything that was certain and trustworthy. Washington Irving, in his work Salmagundi, 1807, included this line:"The copper-bottomed angel at Messrs. Paff's in Broadway."It wasn't all plain sailing. Pay attention at the back, here's the science bit:Copper and iron, when immersed in a suitable electrolytic fluid, like fruit juice or, at a pinch, seawater, form an electrochemical couple and the arrangement becomes a serviceable galvanic battery. Over time, the iron is eaten away to nothing by the electrochemical action. That wasn't good news for mariners who fixed their boat's copper plates using iron nails - the iron eroded and the plates went to visit Davy Jones. Copper nails were the answer and soon afterwards ships began to be described not only as copper-bottomed but also copper-fastened. Such technically top-of-the-range ships were well thought of; an example is found in the 9th July 1796 edition of The Hull Advertiser: She is copper-fastened and copper-bottomed, and a remarkable fine ship. The expression 'copper-fastened' was and is used quite infrequently and is often wrongly taken to be a simple misstating of 'copper-bottomed'. Its meaning is similar but with the emphasis on security and lack of any ambiguity, rather than of certainty and trustworthiness. It had to wait longer to be taken into metaphorical use - until the 20th century in fact. An example of such is to be found in The Evening Independent, November 1948:We had some striking examples of what happens when a guy gets so big for his britches that any pal of his is automatically a copper-fastened genius.

The proof of the puddingMeaningTo fully test something you need to experience it yourself.Origin'The proof of the pudding' is just shorthand for 'the proof of the pudding is in the eating'. That makes sense at least, whereas the shortened version really doesn't mean anything. Nor does the often-quoted incorrect variation 'the proof is in the pudding'. The continued use of that meaningless version is no doubt bolstered by the fact that the correct version isn't that easy to understand. The meaning become clear when you know that 'proof' here means 'test'. The more common meaning of proof in our day and age is 'the evidence that demonstrates a truth' - as in a mathematical or legal proof. The verb form meaning 'to test' is less often used these days, although it does survive in several commonly used phrases: 'the exception that proves the rule', 'proof-read', 'proving-ground', etc. Clearly, the distinction between these two forms of the word was originally quite slight and the proof in a 'showing to be true' sense is merely the successful outcome of a test of whether a proposition is correct or not.'The proof of the pudding is in the eating' is a very old proverb. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations dates it back to the early 14th century, albeit without offering any supporting evidence. The phrase is widely attributed to Cervantes in The History of Don Quixote. This appears to be by virtue of an early 18th century translation by Peter Motteux, which has been criticised by later scholars as 'a loose paraphrase' and 'Franco-Cockney'. Crucially the Spanish word for pudding - 'budín', doesn't appear in the original Spanish text.The earliest printed example of the proverb that I can find is in William Camden's Remaines of a Greater Worke Concerning Britaine, 1605:"All the proof of a pudding is in the eating."It is worth remembering that, as the phrase is quite old, the pudding wouldn't have been a sticky toffee pudding from the sweet trolley, but a potentially fatal savoury dish. In Camden's listing of proverbs he also includes "If you eat a pudding at home, the dog may have the skin", which suggests that the pudding he had in mind was some form of sausage. THE OED describes the mediaeval pudding as 'the stomach or one of the entrails of a pig, sheep, or other animal, stuffed with a mixture of minced meat, suet, oatmeal, seasoning, etc., and boiled'. Those of you who have ventured north of the border on Burns Night will recognize this as a fair description of a haggis - "the great chieftain o' the pudding-race", as Burns called it in the poem Address to a Haggis, 1786. Mediaeval peasants, faced with a boiled up farmyard massacre, might have thought a taste test to have been a wise choice.

Rule of thumbMeaningA means of estimation made according to a rough and ready practical rule, not based on science or exact measurement. OriginThe 'rule of thumb' has been said to derive from the belief that English law allowed a man to beat his wife with a stick so long as it is was no thicker than his thumb. In 1782, Judge Sir Francis Buller is reported as having made this legal ruling and in the following year James Gillray published a satirical cartoon attacking Buller and caricaturing him as 'Judge Thumb'. The cartoon shows a man beating a fleeing woman and Buller carrying two bundles of sticks. The caption reads "thumbsticks - for family correction: warranted lawful!"It seems that Buller was hard done by. He was notoriously harsh in his punishments and had a reputation for arrogance, but there's no evidence that he ever made the ruling that he is infamous for. Edward Foss, in his authoritative work The Judges of England, 1870, wrote that, despite a searching investigation, "no substantial evidence has been found that he ever expressed so ungallant an opinion". It's certainly the case that, although British common law once held that it was legal for a man to chastise his wife in moderation (whatever that meant), the 'rule of thumb' has never been the law in England. Even if people mistakenly supposed the law to exist, there's no reason to believe that anyone ever called it the 'rule of thumb'. Despite the phrase being in common use since the 17th century and appearing many thousands of times in print, there are no printed records that associate it with domestic violence until the 1970s, when the notion was castigated by feminists. The responses that circulated then, which assumed the wife-beating law to be true, may have been influenced by Gillray's cartoon or were possibly a reaction to The Rolling Stones' song 'Under My Thumb', which was recorded in 1966. The phrase itself has been in circulation since the 1600s. In 1692, it appeared in print in Sir William Hope's training manual for aspiring swordsmen, The Compleat Fencing-master:"What he doth, he doth by rule of Thumb, and not by Art."The origin of the phrase remains unknown. It is likely that it refers to one of the numerous ways that thumbs have been used to estimate things - judging the alignment or distance of an object by holding the thumb in one's eye-line, the temperature of brews of beer, measurement of an inch from the joint to the nail to the tip, or across the thumb, etc. The phrase joins the whole nine yards as one that probably derives from some form of measurement but which is unlikely ever to be definitively pinned down. The earliest such 'measurement' use that I can find referred to in print is in a journal of amusing tales with the comprehensive title of Witt's Recreations - Augmented with Ingenious Conceites for the Wittie and Merrie Medicines for the Melancholic. It was published in 1640 and contains this rhyme:If Hercules tall stature might be guess'dBut by his thumb, the index of the rest,In due proportion, the best rule that IWould chuse, to measure Venus beauty by,Should be her leg and foot: The 'rule of leg' never caught on.

La-di-daMeaningUsed to highlight and ridicule snobbish forms of behaviour or speech.Origin'La-di-da' was fading out of use in the language until it staged something of a comeback following its use by the eponymous heroine of the 1977 film Annie Hall. Diane Keaton's character actually said 'La-di-da, la-di-da, la la'. This wasn't a reference to swanky or snobbish behaviour - it was used as a meaningless phrase, spoken out of context when nervous, to emphasize Hall's ditzy personality. The expression was in general use by the 1880s. This usage was probably advanced by the inclusion of 'la-di-da' in some songs of the day. George Duckworth Atkin and others collected many of these in the journal House Scraps, which was published around 1883, and included these two songs:We are a Merry Family, We are! we are! we are!Jack, he deals in Canadas, In Trunks, one, two, or three; Willie, he gives turns away, But not to you or me.The young 'un goes to music-halls, And does the la-di-da; We are a shiney family, We are! we are! we are! Untitled:La-di-da, La-di-do, He's a well-known old Adonis, La-di-da, La-di-do, You may tell it by his nose, La-di-da, La-di-do, For the colour all his own is, It's a pleasing combinationOf the beetroot and the rose.'La-di-da' sounds as though it may be of French origin. In fact, it isn't and derives from the earlier reduplicated phrase 'lardy-dardy'. That phrase was cited in Lacy's Acting Edition of Plays, Dramas, Farces and Extravagances, 1849:One of those haw-haw fellows, who used to hang around you - lardy dardy, pois'ning the atmosphere with their pomadey. [Note: pomade has two meanings - either a type of cider or a sticky, scented gel used to dress hair. We can safely assume the above citation refers to the latter.] That example shows 'lardy dardy' used as an exclamation. Other contemporary sources used it in the current descriptive manner, for example, this piece from Mary Elizabeth Braddon's novel Three times dead; or, The secret of the heath, 1859:You're not much good, my friend, says I, with your lardy dardy ways, and your cold blooded words.Reduplicated expressions like lardy-dardy usually have one word that supplies the meaning and a secondary rhyming word, which is added for emphasis. In this case the significant word is 'lardy'. These days, 'lardy' just means 'full of lard', like lardy cakes, the sweet, fatty 'heart attack on a plate' buns that are still sold in the UK without any form of health warning. 'Lardy-dardy and 'la-di-da' have nothing to do with lard. It is more likely that 'lardy' was a corruption of 'lady' or 'lordy', which match the meaning of the phrases. See other reduplicated phrases.

Old codgerMeaningAn old man, especially one who is eccentric, curmudgeonly or grotesque.OriginAn episode of the UK Channel4 archeological series Time Team, in April 2009, featured an item on falconry. A falconer, suitably dressed in mock-tudor doublet and hose, explained that the frame that was used to carry falcons to the field was called a cadge (probably a variant of 'cage'). Frame carrying was said to be a job for elderly falconers, who came to be called 'old cadgers' and later, 'old codgers'. He also threw in for good measure that this was also the derivation of 'cadging a lift' (a.k.a. 'cadge a ride').Time Team includes senior academics who expect a good standard of historical and archeological evidence to support theories about the origins of the buildings and the artefacts that they dig up. Regrettably, those standards go out of the window when it comes to words and phrases. The 'old codger' assertion came with no evidence at all and yet it was confidently broadcast as fact. In truth, it is a highly dubious claim. The 'cadge a lift' theory is certainly wrong. That phrase isn't known until the 19th century, well after falconry had become uncommon and, in any case, that 'beg/borrow' meaning of cadge was in use as a general term for 'obtaining without payment' and only later became used in 'cadge a lift'. As to 'old codger', it is the begging sense of cadge rather than the falcon transport meaning that is much more likely to be linked to 'cadger' and later 'codger'. The earliest meaning of 'cadger', which pre-dates the naming of falconry cadges by a good two hundred years, was as the name of itinerant dealers who traded in butter/eggs etc., which they transported by pack-horse. This dates from the 15th century and was referred to in Robert Henryson's The Morall Fabillis of Esope, circa 1450:"A Cadgear, with capill and with creils". [horse and baskets] Over time, less respectable tramps, beggers and smugglers also began to be called cadgers. Cadging changed from 'trading' to begging/borrowing'. By the early 19th century, any ne'er-do-well who made a living by questionable means might be called a cadger. William Hone's The Every-day Book, 1825, lists that meaning: "A rosinante [a worn-out horse], borrowed from some whiskey smuggler or cadger."The link between cadger and codger is complex. In some parts of England the two words were used interchangeably, whereas in other regions they were separate words, one meaning 'beggar' and the other 'eccentric/grotesque fellow'. The latter meaning is the one used in an early example of 'old codger', David Garrick's farce Bon Ton, 1775:"My Lord's servants call you an old out-of-fashion'd Codger."Men who had fallen on hard times and had resorted to any means possible to keep body and soul together were often those who were too old to find work. A cadger was likely to be a grizzled character wanting to borrow or steal from you; a codger was a peculiar and unfashionable chap, and both were likely to be old. 'Old codger' is most likely to be the linguistic merging of all those images. What is less likely is that the first such codger was seen carrying a cage of falcons.

Cherchez la femmeMeaningThe translation from the French is "look for/seek the woman". It is used when a man behaves unusually or gets into a quarrel or other difficulty and the reason for it is sought. Origin'Cherchez la femme' is sometimes mistakenly thought to refer to men's attempts to pursue romantic liaisons with women. In fact, the phrase, which is occasionally used in its loose English translation 'look for the woman', expresses the idea that the source of any given problem involving a man is liable to be a woman. That isn't to say that the woman herself was necessarily the direct cause of the problem, as in Shakespeare's Macbeth for instance, but that a man has behaved stupidly or out of character in order to impress a woman or gain her favour. The expression was coined by Alexandre Dumas (père) in the novel The Mohicans of Paris, 1864, in the form of 'cherchons la femme'. In John Latey's 1878 English translation, Dumas' detective, Monsieur Jackal, concludes that a woman must have been involved in the crime being investigated:"Where's the woman? Seek her."His opinion was later confirmed by a colleague: "Ah! Monsieur Jackal, you were right when you said, 'Seek the woman.'"The phrase was adopted into everyday English use and crossed the Atlantic by 1909. It was well enough known there by that date for O. Henry (William Sydney Porter) to use it as the title of a story - Cherchez La Femme, which includes this line:"Ah! yes, I know most time when those men lose money you say 'Cherchez la femme' - there is somewhere the woman."Dumas was, of course, the author of many popular novels, including The Count of Monte-Cristo, 1844, from which he earned a sizeable fortune. He had a bash at following in the footsteps of his eponymous hero when he had the lavish Château de Monte-Cristo built in 1846. Life copied art also in his ruinous attempts to attract women to the high life at the chateau. When biographers looked to see where all his money went, the only explanation needed was 'cherchez les femmes'

Cotton-pickingMeaningA general term of disapproval, of something that is troublesome or a nuisance. OriginIt can come as as little surprise that the term 'cotton-picking' originated in the southern states of the USA. It began life in the late 1700s and differs from the 19th century Dixie term, 'cottonpicker', in that the latter was derogatory and racist, whereas 'cotton-picking' referred directly to the difficulty and harshness of gathering the crop. Of course, 'cotton-picking' must have been in use as an English adjectival phrase for as long as English-speaking people have picked cotton. There are numerous citations of 'cotton-picking' seasons/jobs/machines etc. since the late 1700s. J & E Pettigrew's Letters has an early example, from 1795:'One of the students was banished... for going to a cotton picking after eight at Knight.'Our folk memory of grizzled cowboys in Hollywood B-features 'fixin to run that cotton-picking greenhorn outta town' etc., might give us cause to think that the use of 'cotton-picking' as a figurative term originated in the 19th century wild west. In fact, it didn't, and it doesn't even seem to have been spoken in any of Hollywood's numerous early cowboy movies. It isn't until the 1940s that the term began to be used in any other context than that of the actual picking of cotton. The earliest such reference that I have found is in the Pennsylvania newspaper, The Daily Courier, November 1942:It's just about time some of our Northern meddlers started keeping their cotton-picking fingers out of the South's business. Where memory doesn't play tricks is when recalling the works of the sainted Bugs Bunny. While not originating the term, Bugs can claim to have done more to fix it into the language than the rest of rabbitkind, especially in its most often used form 'Wait just a cotton-picking minute'. There's an example in Bully for Bugs, 1953: "Just a cotton-pickin' minute, this don't look like the Coachella Valley to me!"

Off his own batMeaningBy an individual's own efforts. OriginOne question that I've been asked several times about the figurative expression 'off his own bat' is "should that be 'off his own back'"? Well no, it shouldn't. 'Off your own back' originated as a mishearing of the former expression. It has gained sufficient currency to be considered as a viable everyday alternative of the correct version, but purists dismiss it as a straightforward error. Bats come in many forms of course and, as is always the case with such words when they occur in phrases where the context clear, the meaning is open to fanciful interpretations. So, as with the yards in 'the whole nine yards', which are guessed to be any number of things, the 'bat' in 'off his own bat' has been said to be one of these: the flying mammal, a butter pat, a tool used in brickmaking etc, etc. In fact, the bat in question is a cricket bat and the first activity that was said to be done 'off someone's own bat' was to score runs. The first citation of 'off his own bat' in print comes from the pen of the celebrated cricket historian and statistician Henry Thomas Waghorn, in Cricket Scores, 1742:"The bets on the Slendon man's head that he got 40 notches off his own bat were lost."The 'Slendon man' was probably Richard Newland, the star of the Slindon Cricket Club and cricket's first great all-rounder. It is worth noting that the phrase is found in print several times during the next century and all of the known citations are explicit cricket references - the other supposed derivations of 'bat' in this context owe everything to imagination and nothing to evidence. There's an example in Our Village: Sketches of Rural Character and Scenery, by Mary Russell Mitford, 1824:"William Grey got forty notches off his own bat; and that brilliant hitter Tom Coper gained eight from two successive balls."Why runs that were scored 'off someone's own bat' were worth mentioning derives from the arcane rules of cricket. Runs, which were often referred to as 'notches' in early references to the game, may be scored in cricket in several different ways. These include various forms of 'extra' runs, for example, bowling misdemeanours like wides or no balls; various forms of 'bye', in which the batsmen run without first hitting the ball; and overthrows, where a fielder throws the ball at the wicket and misses, giving time for the batsmen to run again. All of these are counted towards the batting side's score, but it is the runs that a batsman scores 'off his own bat' that gain kudos for the player. The first usage of 'off his own bat' as a figurative, i.e. non-cricket, phrase is in Fragment on Irish Affairs by the Rev. Sydney Smith, May 1845:"Dr. Hodgson is a very worthy, amiable man... but [I] suppose he had no revenues but what he got off his own bat."

Someone is walking over my graveMeaningA response to a sudden unexplained shudder or shivering.Origin'Someone is walking over my grave' seems a rather odd thing for a living person to say when experiencing a sudden shudder, so why is it said? The 18th saying derives from an earlier folk legend that a sudden cold sensation was caused by someone walking over the place that one's grave was eventually going to be. This belief is in line with the workings of people's minds in England in the Middle Ages, in which the distinction between life and death was much less clear than we see it now. There was then an unambiguous belief in the everyday communication between the afterlife in heaven or hell and the physical world of the living. When someone dies in our day and age we a likely to hold a commemorative gathering where we talk about the deceased person. Mediaeval mourners would hold wakes, in which they spoke to the deceased, in the belief that their words were being heard and understood. A person's final resting place would also have been understood to be predetermined and 'someone has walked over my grave' would have been said in the belief that a real person had actually walked over the ground where the speaker would be interred.The earliest known record of the phrase in print, which is of course an indication of the earliest date that we can prove that the phrase was in public use, is in Simon Wagstaff's A Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious Conversation, 1738. (Simon Wagstaff was one of the many pseudonyms of the celebrated writer Jonathan Swift):Miss [shuddering]. Lord! there's somebody walking over my Grave. The old folk belief is recorded by the Yorkshire novelist Harriet Parr, who also used a pseudonym, that of Holme Lee, in Basil Godfrey's Caprice, 1868:Joan shuddered - that irrepressible convulsive shudder which old wives say is caused by a footstep walking over the place of our grave that shall be.The expression is sometimes found in the form of 'a goose (or occasionally, a rabbit) walked over my grave'. These are later and chiefly American variants and the 'goose' version at least appears to be a back-formation, derived from 'goose bumps/goose pimples' which are associated with a sudden feeling of chilliness.The modern-day scientific explanation for sudden unexplained shuddering and for goose pimples is that they are caused by a subconscious release of the stress hormone adrenaline. This may be as a response to coldness or an emotional reaction to a poignant memory. Fanciful it may be, but somehow, I prefer the mediaeval version.

The hair of the dogMeaningA small measure of drink, intended to cure a hangover. OriginThe fuller version of this phrase, i.e. 'the hair of the dog that bit me', gives a clue to the source of the name of this supposed hangover cure. That derivation is from the mediaeval belief that, when someone was bitten by a rabid dog, a cure could be made by applying the same dog's hair to the infected wound. How many people managed to get bitten again when trying to approach the aforesaid dog to acquire the hair to achieve this completely useless remedy isn't known. The knowledge of the derivation should at least put paid to the frequent 'hare of the dog' misspelling.With most metaphorical phrases that have a literal origin, for example toe the line and on the warpath, the later figurative use doesn't become popular until the literal use has fallen out of use. 'The hair of the dog' is unusual in that the figurative version is recorded before any known examples of the literal meaning. John Heywood, in his invaluable early text, A dialogue conteinyng the nomber in effect of all the prouerbes in the Englishe tongue, 1546, uses the phrase with a clear reference to drinking:I pray thee let me and my fellow have A hair of the dog that bit us last night - And bitten were we both to the brain aright. We saw each other drunk in the good ale glass.Another useful text, Randle Cotgrave's A dictionarie of the French and English tongues, 1611, also records the 'drinking' version of the expression:Our Ale-knights [habitual drinkers] often use this phrase, and say, Give us a haire of the dog that last bit us.It isn't until the 18th century that the literal use of dogs' hair to cure bite wounds is recorded in print. Robert James alludes to the method in A Treatise on Canine Madness, 1760:The hair of the dog that gave the wound is advised as an application to the part injured.In fact, James is rather skeptical about the treatment, preferring another commonly believed but equally unpromising remedy - the application of the ashes of river crabs.Whilst the hair of the dog that bit us is now dismissed as an effective rabies treatment, the taking of additional alcohol to cure a hangover has some scientific basis. The symptoms of hangover are partly induced by a withdrawal from alcohol poisoning. A small measure of alcohol may be some temporary relief, even if in the longer term it makes the hangover worse.

Plain sailingMeaningAn easy, uncomplicated course. Origin'Plain sailing' is a nautical phrase that has the literal meaning of 'sailing that is easy and uncomplicated'. We now use the phrase to describe any straightforward and trouble-free activity. There might seem to be be little more to say about this phrase, if it weren't for the existence of 'plane sailing'. 'Plane sailing' is a simplified form of navigation, in which the surface of the sea is considered to be flat, i.e. what mathematicians call a plane surface. The plane method of approximation made the calculations of distance much easier than those of 'Mercator's sailing', in which the curvature of the earth was taken into account. So, 'plane sailing' was 'plain sailing'. It would be rather neat if 'plane sailing' came first and that, being an easy and uncomplicated method, it came to be called 'plain sailing'. In fact, it is the 'plain' spelling that is found first in print, in Adam Martindale's A Collection of Letters for Improvement of Husbandry & Trade, 1683: A token for ship boys, plain-sailing made more plain and short than usually, in three particular methods. The term must have been in regular use by the turn of the 18th century as, in 1707, Edward Ward made metaphorical use of it in The Wooden World Dissected:Tho' he guide others to Heaven by the plain-sailing Rules of the Gospel.The first known use of 'plane sailing' isn't found until much later, in James Atkinson's Epitome of the Art of Navigation, 1749:Plane Trigonometry applied in Problems of Sailing by the Plane Sea-Chart, commonly called Plane-Sailing.Most people now make a distinction between 'plain', i.e. easy and simple, and 'plane', i.e. flat. That wasn't so when this phrase was coined. Since the 14th century, although less so more recently, various spellings for 'level and flat' have been accepted - plane, pleyne, playn and, significantly in this context, plain. So, although 'plane sailing' is unambiguous, when a writer used 'plain sailing' any number of things may have been on his/her mind:- Sailing that was easy.- Sailing on a flat, level sea.- Navigation that was calculated using plane (a.k.a. plain) trigonometry.- Any straightforward task. In recent years, the introduction of the phrase 'clear sailing' as an alternative to 'plain sailing' may have cleared things up a little. This was used to good, if rather poignant, comic effect in The Simpsons' cartoon The Simpsons Bible Stories, 1999:Milhouse: Well, Lisa, we're out of Egypt. So, what's next for the Israelites? Land of milk and honey?Lisa: [consulting a scroll] Hmm, well, actually it looks like we're in for forty years of wandering the desert.Milhouse: Forty years! But after that, it's clear sailing for the Jews, right?Lisa: [nervously] Uh-huh-hum, more or less.

Movers and shakersMeaningPeople of energetic demeanour, who initiate change and influence events.OriginThe expression 'movers and shakers' is now most often applied to the rich and powerful in politics and business. In a year (2009) in which the movers and shakers of the financial world brought us to the brink of ruin, it is worth a thought as to who the original movers and shakers were. The public perception of the term began after the first performance of Sir Edward Elgar's popular choral work The Music Makers, at the Birmingham Festival in October 1912. The work is a setting of Arthur O'Shaughnessy's 1874 poem 'Ode', from his Music and Moonlight collection. In that poem, which singles out poets and musicians as the bards that guide lay thinking, O'Shaughnessy coined the phrase 'movers and shakers': We are the music makers,And we are the dreamers of dreams,Wandering by lone sea-breakers,And sitting by desolate streams; World-losers and world-forsakers,On whom the pale moon gleams:Yet we are the movers and shakersOf the world for ever, it seems.By 'shakers', O'Shaughnessy didn't mean the Shakers that are an offshoot of the Quaker religion, more fully known as the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, but simply those who shake the foundations of conventional thinking by the strength of their imagination and vision.The poem is by far O'Shaughnessy's best known work and it had a profound effect on Elgar, who set the complete poem without alteration. The two men were admirers of each other's work and, judging from from their photographs, would have made a strong joint entry in a 'Spot the Victorian Gentleman' competition. Nevertheless, although the first two lines of the poem became well known, the phrase 'movers and shakers' didn't begin to be used more widely until well into the 20th century, when it was taken up in the USA. It was hardly used at all until the American socialite and patron of the arts Mabel Dodge Luhan used it as the title of a volume of her autobiography, published in 1934. 'Movers and shakers', along with the alternative 'shakers and movers', which was clearly coined in ignorance of the poetic original, began to be used commonly in the USA in the 1960s and 70s and later in other countries. It was then exclusively applied to people in business and other positions of power. For example, from the magazine Ebony, July 1962:The fabulous Rollins sisters were operating a Paris-style salon for movers and shakers.

Pass the buckMeaningEvade responsibility by passing it on to someone else.OriginLook up 'buck' in the dictionary and you'll find a couple of dozen assorted nouns, verbs and adjectives. The most common use of the word these days is as the slang term for the American dollar. That's not the buck meant here though. Look a little further down the list and you'll find the definition 'buck: an article used in a game of poker' - and that's the buck that was first passed. Poker became very popular in America during the second half of the 19th century. Players were highly suspicious of cheating or any form of bias and there's considerable folklore depicting gunslingers in shoot-outs based on accusations of dirty dealing. In order to avoid unfairness the deal changed hands during sessions. The person who was next in line to deal would be given a marker. This was often a knife, and knives often had handles made of buck's horn - hence the marker becoming known as a buck. When the dealer's turn was done he 'passed the buck'. Silver dollars were later used as markers and this is probably the origin of the use of buck as a slang term for dollar. The earliest citation that I can find of the literal use of the phrase in print is from the Weekly New Mexican, July 1865:They draw at the commissary, and at poker after they have passed the 'buck'.This is clearly around the time that the phrase was coined, as there are several such printed citations in the following years. The figurative version of the phrase, i.e. a usage where no actual buck is present, begins around the start of the 20th century. For example, this piece in the California newspaper The Oakland Tribune, from May, 1902:[Oakland City Attorney] Dow - 'When the public or the Council "pass the buck" up to me I am going to act.'The reporter's use of quotation marks around pass the buck indicate its recent coinage as a figurative phrase, or at least one that the paper's readers might not have been expected to be familiar with. The best-known use of buck in this context is 'the buck stops here', which was the promise made by US president Harry S. Truman, and which he kept prominent in his own and his electors' minds by putting it on a sign on his desk.

Tempest in a teapotMeaningA small or unimportant event that is over-reacted to, as if it were of considerably more consequence.OriginReaders from England might well be tut-tutting about the mangling of their perfectly good phrase 'a storm in a teacup' and castigating the American 'tempest in a teapot' as a newcomer, having little more reason to exist than its neat alliteration. In fact, the teacup wasn't the first location of the said storm, nor was the teapot. The phrase probably derives from the writing of Cicero, in De Legibus, circa 520BC. The translation of his "Excitabat fluctus in simpulo" is often given as "He was stirring up billows in a ladle" (correctly translated or not, I don't know; I don't speak Latin). Whether the first user of the expression in English had Cicero in mind, he made no mention of tea-making, although he wasn't so far away. The Duke of Ormond's letters to the Earl of Arlington, 1678, include this:"Our skirmish seems to be come to a period, and compared with the great things now on foot, is but a storm in a cream bowl."Also, before the 'teacup/teapot' versions were well-established, another nobleman came up with a version that didn't involve the tea-table at all. The Gentleman's Magazine, 1830, records:"Each campaign, compared with those of Europe, has been only, in Lord Thurlow's phrase, a storm in a wash-hand basin." 'Tempest in a teapot' is the version that is used most often in the USA, and hardly at all in other places, but which nevertheless appears to have a Scottish rather than an American origin. Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, 1825, included a debate over the relative merits of the Scottish poets James Hogg and Tom Campbell. Campbell's imagery of raging tempests in his poetic work wasn't well received there: What is the 'tempest raging o'er the realms of ice'? A tempest in a teapot!Finally, we come to the version of the phrase that we English might imagine is the 'proper' original version. This appears to be neither original or English as it is later than the versions above, and the first mention that I can find of it also hails from north of the border. Catherine Sinclair, the Scottish novelist and children's writer, wrote a novel of fashionable society life, Modern Accomplishments, or the march of intellect, in 1838:"As for your father's good-humoured jests being ever taken up as a serious affair, it really is like raising a storm in a teacup."

Fuddy-duddyMeaningA stuffy or foolishly old-fashioned person.OriginIf any term sounds old and English, it must be this one. As so often, intuition is found to be inadequate as fuddy-duddy appears to be of American origin, possibly via Scotland, nor is it especially old. The first record that I can find of it is from the Texas newspaper The Galveston Daily News, 1889:"Look here; I'm Smith - Hamilton Smith. I'm a minister and I try to do about right ... I object to being represented as an old fuddy-duddy."That usage - without any accompanying explanation - seems to suggest that the readership would have been expected to have been familiar with it. That is quite possible, there are several citations in American newspapers from the end of the 19th century that relate to a pair of fictional wags called Fuddy and Duddy. A string of their rather weak gags was printed in the Boston Evening Transcript. Here's an example from a November 1895 edition:Fuddy: So Miss Dandervecken is going to marry an Englishman. A lord, I suppose?Duddy: Well, no, not exactly: but I understand that he's often as drunk as a lord. Whether or not the expression 'fuddy-duddy' was already known and the names were taken from it, or whether it was the other way round, we can't now tell. The coincidence in the dates of the arrival of the two characters and the phrase does suggest that there was a connection of some kind. Duddy was a Scottish term meaning ragged - duds having been used to refer to rough tattered clothes since the 15th century. Fud, or fuddy, was a Scots dialect term for buttocks. In 1833, the Scots poet James Ballantyne wrote The Wee Raggit Laddie: Wee stuffy, stumpy, dumpie laddie,Thou urchin elfin, bare an' duddy,Thy plumpit kite an' cheek sae ruddyAre fairly baggit,Although the breekums on thy fuddyAre e'en right raggit.The full-on Scots dialect in that sentimental, Burns influenced rhyme is difficult to translate precisely. The gist of the meaning is:Poor scruffy little lad, bare and ragged, your wet belly and red cheeks are swollen and the trousers on your buttocks are torn. There is a British term - 'duddy fuddiel', which is also recorded from around the same date. William Dickinson's A glossary of words and phrases pertaining to the dialect of Cumberland, 1899, has:"Duddy fuddiel, a ragged fellow."There may be a link between 'duddy fuddiel' and 'fuddy-duddy' but, as they don't mean exactly the same thing, we can't be certain. One thing we can be sure about; that the cartoon character Elmer Fudd inherited the name from the phrase. 'Fuddy-duddy' was in general circulation in the US well before the character was created in around 1940 and the expression accords with his old-fashioned and obsessive temperament. In a rather sad sequel to the Boston Transcript's role in the coining of 'fuddy-duddy', Time magazine reported in 1939 that a survey commissioned by the paper found that, "the most frequent word used by advertisers to describe the paper was fuddy-duddy". The Transcript ceased trading soon afterwards. See also - other reduplicated phrases.

The jury is still outMeaningJudgement has not yet been finalised on a particular subject; especially due to information being incomplete. Origin'The Jury Is Still Out' has been a staple headline in US newspapers for at least 150 years. For example, this from The New York Daily-Times, May 1850:"The [Gardiner Trial] Jury are still out, with no prospect of immediate agreement."The phrase has continued to be used in this literal sense. The emergence of the figurative use of 'the jury is still out', i.e. as a reference to a non-legal decision where no actual jury is involved, began in the USA in the 1940s and has now become somewhat hackneyed. For example, the expression was used in a report of a baseball game, published in the Indiana newspaper The Terre Haute Star in July 1949:The jury is still out on his [Orestes Minoso] batting ability.There are a few examples of the phrase's use, mostly in a sporting context, throughout the 1940s and 50s, but it was a specific event that brought it fully into the language - the infamous Finch-Tregoff murder trials in 1959/61. Dr. Bernard Finch was a middle-aged Los Angeles surgeon and Carole Tregoff was described in newspapers at the time as 'his shapely young receptionist'. The murder of Finch's wife and the subsequent trials were a cause célèbre. At each of the the couple's three trials the jury took their time in coming to a judgement and hacks must have got tired of typing 'Jury Still Out' each day. This newspaper cutting was typical of the hundreds of stories that ran during 1959 to 1961:At the third trial, during March and April 1961, the pair were finally convicted of murder. Had Dr. Finch kept his mind on surgery, we would probably not now have the cliché 'the jury is still out' at our disposal. I'll leave it to you to decide whether that's to the good or not.

Swan songMeaningA final gesture or performance, given before dying.OriginThis term derived from the legend that, while they are mute during the rest of their lives, swans sing beautifully and mournfully just before they die. This isn't actually the case - swans, even the inaccurately named Mute Swans, have a variety of vocal sounds and they don't sing before they die. The legend was known to be false as early as the days of ancient Greece, when Pliny the Elder refuted it in Natural History, AD 77:"Observation shows that the story that the dying swan sings is false."Nevertheless, poetic imagery proved to be more attractive than scientific method and many poets and playwrights made use of the fable long after Pliny's observations. Chaucer included this line in the poem Parliament of Fowles:The Ialous swan, ayens his deth that singeth. [The jealous swan, sings before his death] Shakespeare, the Swan of Avon no less, used the image in The Merchant of Venice, 1596:Portia: Let music sound while he doth make his choice; then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end, fading in music.The actual term 'swan song', with its current figurative meaning, doesn't crop up in print until the 18th century. The Scottish cleric Jon Willison used the expression in one of his Scripture Songs, 1767, where he refers to "King David's swan-song". The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) turned the phrase on its head in the poem On a Volunteer Singer:Swans sing before they die; ’twere no bad thingDid certain persons die before they sing.If people ever did believe in the 'singing before death' story, few would now claim to do so. 'Swan-song' is now used figuratively and most commonly to refer to celebrated performers embarking on 'farewell tours' or 'final performances'. Those ironic quote marks were never more appropriate than in the case of Nellie Melba, whose swan song consisted of an eight year long string of 'final concerts' between 1920 and 1928. This led to the popular Australian phrase - 'more farewells than Nellie Melba'.

By hook or by crookMeaningBy whatever means necessary - be they fair or foul. OriginIt is sometimes suggested that 'by hook or by crook' derives from the custom in mediaeval England of allowing peasants to take from royal forests whatever deadwood they could pull down with a shepherd's crook or cut with a reaper's billhook. This feudal custom was recorded in the 1820s by the English rural campaigner William Cobbett, although the custom itself long predates that reference. Another commonly repeated suggestion is that the phrase comes from the names of the villages of Hook Head and the nearby Crooke, in Waterford, Ireland. Hook Head and Crooke are on opposite sides of the Waterford channel and Cromwell (born 1599 - died 1658) is reputed to have said that Waterford would fall 'by Hook or by Crooke', i.e. by a landing of his army at one of those two places. A third suggestion is that the phrase derives from two learned judges, called Hooke and Crooke, who officiated during the reign of Charles I (born 1600 - died 1649) and who were called on to solve difficult legal cases. Hence, the cases would be resolved 'by Hooke or by Crooke'. Only the first of the above suggestions stands up to scrutiny by virtue of the age of the phrase. The earliest references to hooks and crooks in this context date back to the 14th century - the first known being from John Gower's Confessio Amantis, 1390:What with hepe [hook] and what with croke [crook] they [by false Witness and Perjury] make her maister ofte winne. Gower didn't use the modern 'by hook or by crook' version of the phrase, but it is clear that he was using the reference to hooks and crooks in the same sense that we do now. The earliest citation of the phrase that I can find is in Philip Stubbes' The Anatomie of Abuses, 1583:Either by hooke or crooke, by night or day. There are several other theories as to the origin of 'by hook or by crook', all of which are either implausible or arose too late. Taking away those, we are left with two serious contenders: sheep farming and wood gathering. Crooks are the curved or hooked sticks that shepherds use to catch sheep by hooking their hind legs. Hook is a synonym for crook. It is quite possible that the two words were put together to mean 'one way or another', for no better reason than the alliteration. Either that, or the 'wood gathering' derivation is correct. We may never know which.

Lose your marblesMeaningLose your wits.OriginTo 'lose one's marbles' is to lose one's mind. In the 1954 film The Caine Mutiny Humphrey Bogart linked insanity with marbles when he showed his character, the demented Lt. Cmdr. Queeg, restlessly jiggling a set of metal balls when under stress in court. Bogart's performance was so affecting that many have supposed the film to be the source of the phrase. It is American, but originated in the late 19th century, not the 1950s. The expression has now been shortened to simply 'losing it'. The point is that the person in question has, as in another earlier variant, 'a bit missing'. Perhaps 'marbles' meant 'mind' or 'wits' before 'lose one's marbles' was coined. That's worth investigation at least, so let's have a go.Marbles are, of course, the little glass or metal balls that children use to play the eponymous game. From the mid 19th century 'marbles' was also used to mean 'personal effects', 'goods', or more generally 'stuff'. This latter meaning derives from the French word 'meubles', which means 'furniture'. From the 1920s onward two US expressions became established - 'to pick up the marbles' and 'to pick up one's marbles'. These mean 'to carry off the honours or prizes' and 'to withdraw from activity or game and cause it to cease' (like the UK variant 'take one's ball home'). 'Marbles' also meant testicles and has been used that way since at least the mid 19th century.It has been suggested that the 'losing one's mind' meaning derives from the Elgin Marbles. These are the collection of sculptures, some from the Parthenon Frieze, which were taken from Athens by Lord Elgin in 1806. The supposition is that the expression derives from the loss of the artworks by the Greeks, or their subsequent loss at sea when the ship that was transporting them sank. An interesting theory, but no more than that; there's no evidence to support the idea. It's more likely that 'marbles' was coined as a slang term meaning 'wits/common sense', as a reference to the marbles that youngsters play with. The notion of 'losing something that is important to you' appears to have migrated from the image of a forlorn child having lost his prized playthings. An early citation of this figurative usage is found in an August 1886 copy of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat:He has roamed the block all morning like a boy who had lost his marbles. During the late 19th century, 'losing one's marbles' began to be used to mean 'getting frustrated or angry'. This reference from New Zealand was printed in The Tuapeka Times, in August 1889:For I tell you that no boy ever lost his marbles more irrevocably than you and I will lose our self-respect if we remain to take part in a wordy discussion that ends in a broil. [a quarrel]This transition to the 'losing one's mind' meaning began in the US around the same time and the Ohio newspaper The Portsmouth Times, reported a story in April 1898 that referred to marbles as a synonym for mental capacity:Prof. J. M. Davis, of Rio Grande college, was selected to present J. W Jones as Gallia's candidate, but got his marbles mixed and did as much for the institution of which he is the noted head as he did for his candidate.The expression took a little time to mature and was used in both 'anger' and 'sanity' senses for a few decades. What is common in all the early citations is the sense of loss and the consequent reaction to it. By 1927, the loss of sanity meaning had won out and an edition of American Speech defined the term unambiguously:"Marbles, doesn't have all his (verb phrase), mentally deficient. 'There goes a man who doesn't have all his marbles.'"See also: knuckle down.

Card-sharpMeaningSomeone who is skilful at playing or manipulating cards, or one who makes a living by cheating at cards. Origin'Card-sharp', which is sometimes spelled either 'card sharp' or 'cardsharp', might be thought by some to be a misspelling of 'card-shark'. The latter is the more commonly used of the two synonymous phrases, especially outside the UK, which is one of the few countries to prefer card-sharp. It is sometimes suggested that one term derived from the other. There's no clear evidence to support that view, although if it is the case then it must have gone from 'sharp' to 'shark' as 'card-sharp' appears to be the older term. Both 'card-sharp' and 'card-shark' originated in the 19th century. There is a 1594 painting by the Italian artist Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), that is called 'The Cardsharps'. Of course, Caravaggio didn't title his paintings in English and it isn't clear when it was given its Anglicized name - probably not until well into the 20th century.Such tricksters were also known as broadsmen or spielers and 'card-sharping' was also called 'Greekery' - a derogatory term that probably wouldn't get past the political-correctness lobby these days.The reason for thinking that 'card-sharp' and card-shark' may be independent coinages is the existence of the two much earlier words 'sharping' (swindling or cheating - circa 1692) and sharking' (cheating, stealing or sponging - circa 1608). These terms for deceitfulness have been adopted in to other phrases, for example, 'sharp practice' and 'loan shark'. Tricksters were called both 'sharps' and 'sharks' well before the 19th century, which makes the separate coinages entirely plausible. Whatever the think about how and when the terms were coined there can be little doubt about where. Both 'card-sharp' and 'card-shark' appear in print in the USA many times before they are seen in publications elsewhere - a sure sign of country of origin. The first such devious card players were called 'card-sharpers' rather than 'card-sharps', although the dates of the earliest known citations of the two terms are close enough together to raise doubts as to which came first. 'Card-sharpers' was recorded by George Augustus Sala, in his Twice round the clock, or the hours of the day and night in London, 1859:"German swindlers and card-sharpers."As mentioned above, the earliest known citations of 'card-sharp' and 'card-shark' come from America. The first of these is in an odd tale indeed. In May 1872, The Hagerstown Mail, printed a bizarre account of a card-playing pig called 'Ugly Ben'. The story, which was written by a journalist who seems to have believed it to be true, tells how the animal pointed to cards with its trotters and played a decent game of euchre - a card game similar to whist. The piece was headed A Porcine Card Sharp:"St. Louis boasts of a hog that shames the most skilful sports a handling playing cards. The specially of the animal is euchre."Clearly, for the term to used like that in a newspaper headline it must already have been well-known to the paper's audience and we may yet find earlier citations. 'Card-shark' comes a few years later as in this example from Wisconsin newspaper The Daily Northwestern, October 1893:"A few days ago Charles Petrie opened a gambling; house, which was promptly raided by the city police. Then Petrie got angry and swore out warrants for all the other keepers until every card shark in the city was taken in."It seems over-generous to have two almost identical terms for the same thing and, in time, no doubt one - probably 'card-shark', will do to 'card-sharp' what grey squirrels have done to red squirrels. Until then, vive la différence.

Birds of a feather flock togetherMeaningThose of similar taste congregate in groups.OriginThis proverb has been in use since at least the mid 16th century. In 1545, William Turner used a version of it in his papist satire The Rescuing of Romish Fox:"Byrdes of on kynde and color flok and flye allwayes together."The first known citation in print of the currently used English version of the phrase appeared in 1599, in The Dictionarie in Spanish and English, which was compiled by the English lexicographer John Minsheu:Birdes of a feather will flocke togither.The phrase also appears in Benjamin Jowett's 1856 translation of Plato's Republic. Clearly, if the it were present in the original Greek text then, at around 380BC, Plato's work would be a much earlier reference to it. What appears in Jowett's version is:Men of my age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says. Plato's text can be translated in other ways and it is safe to say it was Jowett in 1856, not Plato in 380BC, that considered the phrase to be old. The lack of any citation of it in English prior to the 16th century does tend to suggest that its literal translation wasn't present in The Republic - a text that was widely read by English scholars of the classics well before the 16th century. In nature, birds of a single species do in fact frequently form flocks. Ornithologists explain this behaviour as a 'safety in numbers' tactic to reduce their risk of predation. In language terms, it was previously more common to refer to birds flying together than flocking together and many early citations use that form, for example Philemon Holland's translation of Livy's Romane historie, 1600:"As commonly birds of a feather will flye together."

Over the moonMeaningVery happy or delighted.Origin'Over the moon' has been part of the language for more than a century. It has become more widely used in the past twenty or thirty years, since it was adopted by English football managers when interviewed after 'the boys' managed a victory.The increased use of televised post-match interviews and hours of studio commentary during the 1970s brought many football managers before the cameras. These days such men are likely to be cultured and erudite Frenchmen or Spaniards. Before that they were usually British ex-footballers who had left schools in the English or Scottish back streets early to play football. It's fair to say that many of them have little interest in the finer points of English grammar.Two of the best-known English football managers of recent years, who have maintained the English tradition with their engagingly entertaining way of mangling the language, are Ron Atkinson and Terry Venables. The list of quotations from them is long and includes:"The Spaniards have been reduced to aiming aimless balls into the box." (Atkinson)"If you can't stand the heat in the dressing room, get out of the kitchen." (Venables) "If Glenn Hoddle said one word to his team at half time, it was concentration and focus." (Atkinson)"I felt a lump in my throat as the ball went in." (Venables) The humorous magazine Private Eye picked up on these and began publishing them in its Colemanballs column. The name was taken from the sports commentator David Coleman, who could give even the managers a run for their money:"Nottingham have now lost six matches in a row without winning." (Coleman) It was really Private Eye's lampooning that made this phrase popular. There is an associated phrase, 'sick as a parrot', which was used when 'the boys' lost. This has a much shorter pedigree and it's quite likely that it was invented by a writer at Private Eye rather than in a football stadium. It certainly gained currency because The Eye always printed the two phrases together in their parodies. 'Sick as a parrot' was probably influenced the the famous Monty Python 'Dead Parrot' sketch, which could be quoted verbatim by many in the UK at the time and which remains one of the most popular sketches ever shown on British TV. Well, that's the last thirty years. The actual origin of 'over the moon' is much earlier and, although not widely used before the 1970s, it would have been familiar to all who grew up in Britain in the 20th century. Why, because the source was included, as High Diddle Diddle, in the influential 16th century nursery rhyme collection, Mother Goose's Melody; or Sonnets from the Cradle, circa 1760:High diddle diddle,The Cat and the Fiddle,The Cow jump'd over the Moon,The little dog laugh'd to see such Craft,And the Dish ran away with the Spoon.As with most nursery rhymes, the first appearance in print may well post-date the first use by years, centuries even - children didn't write their rhymes down. The text of such rhymes was subject to a 'Chinese whispers' effect over all of that time and, whatever the origin may have been, the version passed down to us is quite probably nonsense and isn't easily interpreted. What is clear is that the 'over the moon' line is a reference to excitement and energy. That's evidenced by one of the earliest allusions to the phrase in print - Charles Molloy's The Coquet, or, The English Chevalier, 1718:"Tis he! I know him now: I shall jump over the Moon for Joy!"

Out of sortsMeaningMildly unwell; not in one's usual health or state of mind. OriginSince at least the 17th century 'sorts' has been the name of the letters used by typographers. This usage is referred to in Notes on a Century of Typography at the University Press Oxford 1693–1794 and is nicely defined in Joseph Moxon's Mechanick Exercises, or the Doctrine of Handy-works - Printing, 1683:"The Letters... in every Box of the Case are... called Sorts in Printers and Founders Language; Thus a is a Sort, b is a Sort." For sets of type blocks to be 'out of sorts' would clearly be unwelcome to a typesetter. That terminology could be the source of the phrase and the notion is certainly a tempting one. We need to be cautious with that attribution however as the above citation is pre-dated by one from The proverbs, epigrams, and miscellanies of John Heywood, 1562, which makes no explicit mention of typesetting:Fit (adj): disordered, out of sortsThat unusual definition of 'fit' is, oddly, almost the opposite of our current usage of the word as an adjective. It may well turn out that pre-1562 citations that refer to typesetting will be found; after all, Gutenberg invented the printing press in around 1440. Until then, I'm sure that many people will opt to believe that 'out of sorts' derives from typesetting. All I can do is present you with the evidence as I find it and let you come to your own conclusions.  PSSpeaking of being 'out of sorts', there's illness in the Martin family just now, so I am donning the nurse's uniform and helping out. We are also moving house. Things are busy here and the weekly mails may be rather shorter than usual over the next month or so and, if I miss one or two, please indulge me.Gary Martin

Pull out all the stopsMeaningMake every possible effort.OriginThe popular belief is that this phrase derives from the manner of construction of pipe organs. These instruments have have stops to control the air flow through the pipes and pulling them out increases the musical volume. This seems to be the type of casual easy answer that is the hallmark of folk etymology. In this case, the popular belief isn't a fallacy but is in fact correct. Prior to the introduction of pipe organs the word 'stop' had, in a musical context, been used to mean 'note' or 'key'. That usage is recorded as early as the late 16th century, as in this example from George Gascoigne's satire The Steele Glas, 1576:"But sweeter soundes, of concorde, peace, and loue, Are out of tune, and iarre in euery stoppe."Of course, 'notes' and 'keys' can't be pulled out. The word 'stop' later came to be used for the knobs that control the flow of air in pipe organs, by pushing them in or, more to the point here, pulling them out. The first person to have used the phrase in a figurative, i.e. non-organ related, sense appears to have been Matthew Arnold, in Essays in Criticism, 1865: "Knowing how unpopular a task one is undertaking when one tries to pull out a few more stops in that... somewhat narrow-toned organ, the modern Englishman."PSThank you to the gratifyingly large number of kind messages of goodwill during my wife's recent illness.Gary Martin

Raze to the groundMeaningTo destroy and sweep completely away. OriginThe expression 'raze to the ground', like 'bated breath' and 'just deserts', is often spelled incorrectly. The sources of these misunderstandings are the homophones 'bated' and 'baited', 'deserts' and 'desserts' and, in 'raze to the ground', 'raze' and 'raise'. Added to that is the fact that the correct spelling in each case is of an archaic word that is rarely used elsewhere. As a child, I heard stories of WWII and of cities like Dresden and Hiroshima being, as I thought, 'raised to the ground'. That seemed odd to me. How could destroying them with bombs raise them? Were these cities underground? It makes a little more sense when we understand that what's being said is akin to 'erased to the ground'. It seems that others are similarly confused - there are currently (Oct 2009) ten times as many hits in Google for 'raise the the ground' as there are for 'raze to the ground'. Razed is hardly a common word now, but it was in the 16th century. For example, Henry Howard, the Earl of Surrey, used it in Aeneid II, 1547, in a context that makes the 'erased' meaning evident:"I saw Troye fall down in burning gledes. Neptunus town clene razed from the soil."Shakespeare also used it in Henry VI Part II, 1591:"These are his substance, sinewes, armes, and strength, With which he ... Razeth your Cities, and subverts your Townes."The earliest example that I can find of the precise 'raze to the ground' form is in The Glory of England, written by Thomas Gainsford in 1620:"King Lewis held nothing in Italy but the lanterne of Genes, which afterward the Genouais razed to the ground."If you invite your neighbours to a barn raising, you had better get the spelling right, or the consequences might be unfortunate. -----------------------BEST REGARDS TO THE AUTHOR GARY MARTIN

In a pickle MeaningIn a quandary or some other difficult position.OriginThe earliest pickles were spicy sauces made to accompany meat dishes. Later, in the 16th century, the name pickle was also given to a mixture of spiced, salted vinegar that was used as a preservative. The word comes from the Dutch or Low German pekel, with the meaning of 'something piquant'. Later still, in the 17th century, the vegetables that were preserved, for example cucumbers and gherkins, also came to be called pickles. The 'in trouble' meaning of 'in a pickle' was an allusion to being as disoriented and mixed up as the stewed vegetables that made up pickles. This was partway to being a literal allusion, as fanciful stories of the day related to hapless people who found themselves on the menu. The earliest known use of pickle in English contains such an citation. The Morte Arthure, circa 1440, relates the gory imagined ingredients of King Arthur's diet:He soupes all this sesoun with seuen knaue childre, Choppid in a chargour of chalke-whytt syluer, With pekill & powdyre of precious spycez. [He dines all season on seven rascal children, chopped, in a bowl of white silver, with pickle and precious spices] The figurative version of the phrase, meaning simply 'in a fix' or, in the almost identical 19th century phrase 'in a stew', arrives during the next century. Thomas Tusser's Five Hundreth Pointes of Good Husbandrie, 1573, contains this useful advice:Reape barlie with sickle, that lies in ill pickle. Presumably, barley that wasn't in ill pickle, i.e. the corn that was standing up straight, would be cut with the larger and more efficient scythe. There are a few references to ill pickles and this pickle etc. in print in the late 16th century, and Shakespeare was one of the first to use in a pickle, in The Tempest, 1611:TRINCULO:I have been in such a pickle since Isaw you last that, I fear me, will never out ofmy bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.A return to the more literal interpretation of the phrase came about in the late 1700s. The Duke of Rutland had toured Britain and wrote up his experiences in a travelogue - Journal of a Tour to the Northern Parts of Great Britain, 1796. He was present at the disinterment of the 350 year-old body of Thomas Beaufort, which he claimed to have been pickled and 'as perfect as when living': The corpse was done up in a pickle, and the face wrapped up in a sear cloth. Just nine years later the most celebrated personage ever to have been literally in a pickle - Admiral Horatio Nelson, met his end, although some pedants might argue that, being preserved in brandy, he found himself in more of a liquor than a pickle. See other phrases and sayings from Shakespeare.

A red rag to a bullMeaningA deliberate provocation, sure to bring about an adverse reaction. OriginIn the 17th century, to wave a red rag at someone was merely to chatter with them - 'red rag' was then a slang term for the tongue. This usage is cited in print as early as 1605 and is nicely illustrated in Francis Grose's definition in The Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1785:"Shut your potatoe trap, and give your redrag a holiday."The waving of a cloth rag at an animal to distract it may have been a common practice for centuries, but it wasn't until the 1700s that it was documented in print. The animal in question wasn't, as we might suppose, a bull. The first creature known to be susceptible to rag waving was that most dim-witted of birds, the pheasant. This was cited in Trenchard and Gordon's religious essays, Cato's Letters, 1724:Foxes are trapann'd [trapped] by Traces, Pheasants by a red Rag, and other Birds by a Whistle; and the same is true of Mankind.Next come vipers, which were also thought to be adversely affected by red rags, as was recorded in The Times in March 1809:"Truth to a lawyer was like a red rag to a viper - it extracted his venom." Bulls come rather a long way down the list of red rag sensitive beings found in early citations. Before them we find turkeys and, not to be left out, Frenchmen - as in Catherine Gore's Memoires of a Peeress, 1837:"They [the English] have no ardour for gratuitous quarrels; they do not fire up like a turkey-cock or a Frenchman, at sight of a red rag."It wasn't until 1873 that someone decided that bulls were to be added to the list, when Charlotte Yonge included an allusion in the novel Pillars of the House:"Jack will do for himself if he tells Wilmet her eyes are violet; it is like a red rag to a bull."The inclusion of bulls to the list was rather misguided. Bulls don't have the optical equipment to distinguish red from other colours, so the 'red rag to a bull' phrase gives the wrong impression. It is generally accepted that bulls are enraged by the waving of the cloth rather than its colour and that a green rag would work just as well. Personally, I've never been close enough to an annoyed bull for a double-blind trial, so to speak, and that is the way I prefer to keep it.

Away with the fairies MeaningNot facing reality; in a dreamworld.OriginThis phrase has its basis in the Scots/Irish Gaelic tradition of belief in a set of folk myths, the cartoon version of which is a belief in the existence of 'the little people'. In a mythology that compares with the current fad for stories of abduction by aliens, Irish folklore had the alien role played by the Sidhe, a dominant, supernatural clan of fairies. The stories involved the Sidhe appearing from some hidden place, either their underground lair or from an invisible world, equivalent to contemporary science's notion of a parallel dimension, and spiriting people away. In another link to current scientific understanding of relativity, the stories usually involved the victim returning after what seemed like a few hours only to find that many years had passed in the world of humans. The everyday belief in a nether world populated by fairies, elves, pixies, leprechauns, goblins and the like was commonplace in mediaeval Europe, as was the belief in their interaction with the real world. A letter to the Scottish poet William Drummond, dated October 1636, contained the following:As for the Fairy Queen, of whom you wrote to me, her Apparitions of late have bewitched so many, that I find sundry ready to dance with the fairies.The belief in people being taken away by the fairies was very well-established by the time that the phrase 'away with the fairies' first came to be used - which isn't until the 20th century. This earliest example of the expression that I can find in print is in the New Zealand newspaper The Otautau Standard and Wallace County Chronicle, May 1909. This retells a story from Ireland, in which a Michael Coyne attempts to convince onlookers that he hadn't murdered his rival, James Bailey: [Coyne] "Don't mind your son; that is not him you see there." Bridget Bailey understood that he meant that her brother was away with the fairies.The phrase didn't begin to be used in its current figurative sense until the late 20th century. This item from The Washington Post, June 1987, is typical of the examples of the phrase that are commonly found from the 1980s onward:"Still away with the fairies, the fey and gentle Incredible String Band epitomised the hippie ideals of the Sixties."

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drinkMeaningPeople, like horses, will only do what they have a mind to do. OriginProverbs give richness to language and, to some extent, define a culture. 'You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink' might be thought to encapsulate the English-speaking people's mindset better than any other saying, as it appears to be the oldest English proverb that is still in regular use today. It was recorded as early as 1175 in Old English Homilies:Hwa is thet mei thet hors wettrien the him self nule drinken [who can give water to the horse that will not drink of its own accord?] There are other pretenders to the throne of the oldest English proverb; for example:A friend in need is a friend indeed.(mid 11th century in English; 5th century BC in Greek)When the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.(late 9th century in English; Bible, Luke Chapter 6)Whilst the above were spoken in English earlier than 'lead a horse to water...', they derive from either a Greek or Biblical source and so can't claim to be the 'full English'. Either that or, like the 11th century proverb 'full cup, steady hand', they haven't stood the test of time. The proverb 'lead a horse to water' has been in continuous use since the 12th century. John Heywood listed it in the influential glossary A Dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of all the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue:"A man maie well bring a horse to the water, But he can not make him drinke without he will."It also appeared in literature over the centuries in a variety of forms. For example, in the play Narcissus, which was published in 1602, of unknown authorship, subtitled as A Twelfe Night merriment, played by youths of the parish at the College of Saint John the Baptist in Oxford: Your parents have done what they coode, They can but bringe horse to the water brinke, But horse may choose whether that horse will drinke. It wasn't until the 20th century that 'lead a horse to water...' got a substantial rewrite, when Dorothy Parker reworked it from its proverbial form into the epigram 'you can lead a horticulture, but you can't make her think'.

Namby-pambyMeaningChildish and weakly sentimental. OriginIn 1714, the English poet and playwright, Ambrose Philips (1674 - 1749) became tutor to George I's grandchildren. The position gave him a status amongst the aristocracy and he took the opportunity to advance his place in society by writing sycophantic sentimental poems in praise of their children. These were written in rather affected and insipid nursery language, of the 'eency-weency', 'goody-goody' sort. This didn't go down well with his rival poets and playwrights and when, in 1725, he wrote the execrable 'To the Honourable Miss Carteret', he was widely derided:Thou, thy parents pride and care,Fairest offspring of the fair...When again the lambkins play,Pretty sportlings,full of Mayand so on His contemporaries Henry Carey, John Gay, Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift combined the cloying nursery reduplication in Philips' work with his first name and came up with a nickname for him - Namby-Pamby. Carey was the first to put it into print, in the poem Namby-Pamby (1725?):All ye poets of the age,All ye witlings of the stage …Namby-Pamby is your guide,Albion's joy, Hibernia's pride.Namby-Pamby, pilly-piss,Rhimy-pim'd on Missy MissTartaretta TartareeFrom the navel to the knee;That her father's gracy graceMight give him a placy place.Pope subsequently made similar fun of Philips in his poem The Dunciad - "Beneath his reign, shall ... Namby Pamby be prefer'd for Wit!"The term began to be used to describe a style of ineffectual writing soon afterwards. For example, William Ayre, in his Memoirs of the life and writings of Alexander Pope (1745), writes:"He [Philips] us'd to write Verses on Infants, in a strange Stile, which Dean [Jonathan] Swift calls the Namby Pamby Stile."It wasn't long before the direct insult to Philips became a new form of general disparagement and 'namby-pamby' entered the language to refer to anything weak or ineffectual. For example, The Westmoreland Magazine, 1774, refers to "A namby-pamby Duke".Philips wasn't amongst the first rank of English poets, but some believe the fact that his only lasting contribution to the language as the butt of the disparaging 'namby-pamby' is rather unfair. He was socially unpopular and remained unmarried, poignantly referring in print to 'a broken love-promise', and his unattractive appearance ("of lean make and pale complexion and five feet seven inches high" - Joseph Spence) made him an easy target. However, no less a champion than Samuel Johnson came to his rescue in asserting that "Philips became ridiculous, without his own fault".Perhaps a kinder epitaph is that 'namby-pamby' was clearly the inspiration for the name of the children's television character, Andy Pandy. The puppet was featured in the classic series Watch With Mother, which was amongst the first television programmes made for children and a mainstay of BBC output in the 1950s.

Sleep tightMeaningSleep well.Origin'Sleep tight' is a very well-used phrase in many parts of the English-speaking world. It's common at bedtime in the form of the rhyme "good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite". There are many meanings of the word 'tight' and, unsurprisingly, there are several theories going the rounds as to the origin of 'sleep tight'. One is that the phrase dates from the days when mattresses were supported by ropes which needed to be pulled tight to provide a well-sprung bed. This was the notion that was put forward on a 2008 BBC antiques show, when the presenter lay on an oak settle to demonstrate the support provided by the understringing and to confidently pronounce "hence the expression 'night, night, sleep tight'". This explanation seems unlikely, as it is the bed rather than its occupant that is tight and no one (in my experience) ever wishes furniture a good night's sleep. He would had more luck had he opted to say that 'settle down to sleep' derives from 'settle' or 'seat' - which it does. The 'don't let the bedbugs bite' part has prompted some to suggest that the 'tight' refers to the tightness of bedclothes, intended to keep bedbugs at bay. That's hardly likely, as bedbugs live in mattresses and wouldn't be avoided by tying bedclothes tightly. Also, '...bedbugs bite' is an extended version of the original 'sleep tight' bedtime message, which didn't start to be used until the mid-20th century - well after 'sleep tight' was first used. 'Sleep tight' didn't derive from either bedcoverings or ancient furniture and, in fact, isn't a very old expression at all. The first citation of it that I can find is from 1866. In her diary Through Some Eventful Years, Susan Bradford Eppes included:"All is ready and we leave as soon as breakfast is over. Goodbye little Diary. ‘Sleep tight and wake bright,’ for I will need you when I return".There aren't many other known citations until the early 20th century and the OED lists none until 1933, by which time the innerspring mattress had been invented and most mattresses were supported by metal straps or springs. This puts the phrase out of general circulation at the date that rope-strung beds were commonly used, which makes the rope-stringing origin unlikely at best. Susan Eppes' line, with its clear link between 'sleep tight' and 'sleep well', leads us to the most probable explanation for the phrase. The word tightly, although not often used in this way now, means 'soundly, properly, well'. The earlier phrase 'tight asleep' derives from this meaning, as seen in this example from Marie Beauchamp's novel Elizabeth and her German Garden, 1898: And once, when there was a storm in the night, she complained loudly, and wanted to know why lieber Gott didn't do the scolding in the daytime, as she had been so tight asleep.'Tight asleep' just meant 'soundly asleep' and 'sleep tight' just means 'sleep soundly'.

Bring home the baconMeaningTo earn money, especially money for one's family; to be successful, especially financially successful. OriginThe origin of the phrase 'bring home the bacon' is muddled by association with other 'bacon' expressions - 'save one's bacon', 'cold shoulder', chew the fat' etc. In reality, the link between them is limited to the fact that bacon has been a slang term for one's body, and by extension one's livelihood or income, since the 17th century. Of course, the source of that 'body' meaning is from bacon coming from the body of a pig or, more accurately, a pig's back and sides. An invented explanation that links 'bringing home the bacon' with the culinary habits of mediaeval English peasantry is given in the nonsense email 'Life in the 1500s'. That ignores the fact that 'bring home the bacon' is a 20th century phrase that was coined in the USA. One field of endeavour in which one's body, i.e. bacon, is the key to one's fortune is boxing, and it is in that sport that the expression first became widely used. Joe Gans and 'Battling' Oliver Nelson fought for the widely reported world lightweight championship on 3rd September 1906. In coverage of the fight, the New York newspaper The Post-Standard, 4th September 1906, reported that:Before the fight Gans received a telegram from his mother: "Joe, the eyes of the world are on you. Everybody says you ought to win. Peter Jackson will tell me the news and you bring home the bacon."Gans (on the right in the picture) won the fight, and The New York Times printed a story saying that he had replied by telegraph that he "had not only the bacon, but the gravy", and that he later sent his mother a cheque for $6,000.A month later, in October 1906, The Oakland Tribune reported another boxing correspondent, Ray Peck, predicting the result of the impending Al Kaufmann/Sam Berger fight in California like this:Kaufmann will bring home the bacon. [He did] There are no newspaper records, or any other printed records that I can find, of 'bring home the bacon' dating from before September 1906, but there are many, most of them boxing-related, from soon afterwards. That's not exactly prrof that the expression was coined by the good Mrs Gans, but we can say at least that she was the one who brought it into the public arena.

A pig in a pokeMeaningAn offering or deal that is foolishly accepted without being examined first.Origin 'Don't buy a pig in a poke' might seem odd and archaic language. It's true that the phrase is very old, but actually it can be taken quite literally and remains good advice. The advice being given is 'don't buy a pig until you have seen it'. This is enshrined in British commercial law as 'caveat emptor' - Latin for 'let the buyer beware'. This remains the guiding principle of commerce in many countries and, in essence, supports the view that if you buy something you take responsibility to make sure it is what you intended to buy.A poke is a sack or bag. It has a French origin as 'poque' and, like several other French words, its a diminutive is formed by adding 'ette' or 'et' - hence 'pocket' began life with the meaning 'small bag'. Poke is still in use in several English-speaking countries, notably Scotland and USA, and describes just the sort of bag that would be useful for carrying a piglet to market. A pig that's in a poke might turn out to be no pig at all. If a merchant tried to cheat by substituting a lower value animal, the trick could be uncovered by letting the cat out of the bag. Many other European languages have a version of this phrase - most of them translating into English as a warning not to 'buy a cat in a bag'. The advice has stood the test of time and people have been repeating it in one form or the other for getting on for five hundred years, maybe longer.Fraser's Magazine (1858) reprinted a piece from Richard Hill's (or Hilles') Common-place Book, 1530, which gave this advice to market traders:"When ye proffer the pigge open the poke."John Heywood included something nearer to our modern-day version of the phrase in Proverbes and Epigrammes, 1555-60:I will neuer bye the pyg in the poke : Thers many a foule pyg in a feyre cloke.See also: 'let the cat out of the bag'.

Full to the gunwalesMeaningFull to the brim; packed tight.Origin'Gunwales' is pronounced like 'gunnels' and it is often spelled that way too. That's not surprising, as the word is no longer in everyday use - pretty much the only thing that most of us know about gunwales is that they can be full or packed. Consult any search engine and you'll find plenty of examples of "full to the gunnels". Nevertheless, 'gunnels' really is a misspelling. An early citation of the word comes from Manners and Household Expenses of England, 1466: Item, the same day my mastyr paid to Roger Fuller, for tymbre for colers [collars] of the maste, and gonne walles...That suggests that the gunwales of a ship were its 'gun walls', which is exactly what they were - hence the spelling. Whenever, as a mere landlubber, I stray into defining maritime terms I inevitably get mail from horny-handed sailors telling me that I've got it all wrong. As a precaution, here's the definition of gunwales from the OED: Gunwales: The upper edge of a ship's side; in large vessels, the uppermost planking, which covers the timber-heads and reaches from the quarter-deck to the forecastle on either side; in small craft, a piece of timber extending round the top side of the hull.The expressions 'full to the gunwales' or 'packed to the gunwales' were first used as literal references to heavily loaded ships. 'Gunwales' may have been a 15th century word, but there's no mention of the phrase until the 19th century, as in the Unitarian periodical, The Monthly Repository, 1834:This is the Island of the Golden Fruit. Look, yonder they come! boats - one, two, three, five, a dozen! all laden up to the gunwales with the juicy balls.The non-nautical use of the phrase didn't come about until the 20th century. A semi-figurative use was made of the phrase in the advertising for the 1944 Dorothy Lamour film, The Fleet's In:The Fleet's In... and it's loaded to the gunwales with the funniest, friskiest entertainment. An example of a properly figurative use, i.e. one set on land rather than aboard ship, comes from The New York Magazine, June 1969:A popular East Side bar, packed to the gunwales with arch young bankers and panicky, pathetic, ersatz Now girls.Not much has changed in the banking world in forty years it seems, and it's all a long way from gun walls.

Toffee-nosedMeaningSnobbish; supercilious; stuck-up. OriginJudging by the queries at my website's Bulletin Board, the British expression 'toffee-nosed' isn't familiar to everyone in the English-speaking world. Whenever it crops up in a BBC drama that is shown in the USA I get mail about it. For those not familiar with it, the meaning is somewhat similar to 'posh'. The origin of 'toffee-nosed' has nothing to do with the sugary, brown sweet, but derives from 'toff', which was the slang term given by the lower-classes in Victorian England to stylishly-dressed upper-class gentlemen. It was recorded by Henry Mayhew in London Labour and the London Poor, 1851:If it's a lady and gentleman, then we cries, 'A toff and a doll!' It is widely agreed amongst etymologists that 'toff' was a corruption of 'tuft', which has a clear aristocratic pedigree, being the ornamental tassel on an academic cap. Specifically, a tuft was the gold tassel originally worn on academic caps at Oxford University by the sons of those peers who had a vote in the House of Lords. They were worn on the celebratory 'Gaudy Days', i.e. the university's twice-yearly feast days (which sound a good deal more fun than 'Dress-down Fridays'). The wearers of the prestigious tufts became known as tufts themselves, even having their own sycophantic crowd of wannabees, known as the 'tufthunters'. If ever there was a tuft, it was the well-connected student Archibald Philip Primrose, the fifth Earl of Rosebery, first Earl of Midlothian and later British Prime Minister. In March 1894, The Westmoreland Gazette reported that:Lord Rosebery was one of the last undergraduates of Christ Church who wore the gold tassel, known by the name of 'tuft', which was the distinguishing mark of noblemen and the sons of noblemen.Tufts were variously called tofts, tuffs and, by 1851 at least, toffs. They were already a well-established breed before 'toffee-nosed' began to be used. That didn't emerge until the early 20th century, as in this definition from Fraser and Gibbons' Soldier and Sailor Words, 1925:Toffee-nosed, stuck up. 'Stuck-up' had emerged a century or so earlier, and is found in Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby, 1839:'He's a nasty stuck-up monkey, that's what I consider him,' said Mrs. Squeers.The 'nosed' part of 'toffee-nosed' appears to derive from the allusion to the haughty toffs, who stuck their noses in the air when faced with the hoi-polloi. See also: POSH.

Hobby-horseMeaningA favourite topic that one frequently refers to or dwells on; a fixation.OriginThe first things that were referred to as hobbies were in fact horses, of a breed that was popular in Ireland in the Middle Ages and is now extinct. The Scottish poet John Barbour referred to them as hobynis, in the narrative poem The Bruce, 1375. In Reliquiae Antiquae, a poetic work of Barbour's from around 1400 and republished in 1841, he referred to them again, this time with a little more context: And one amang, an Iyrysch man, Uppone his hoby swyftly ran,English mummers, morris dance teams and minstrel groups began performing with characters (often children) dressed in wickerwork and cloth costumes, made to look like stylised horses - not altogether unlike the present-day pantomime horses. These 'hobby-horses', which took their name from the Irish breed, are still to be seen as part of the English folk tradition, notably at the annual 'Obby 'Oss festival, celebrated each May Day in Padstow, Cornwall. This custom dates back to at least the 16th century, when a payment for a performance by a hobby-horse was recorded in the Churchwarden's Accounts of St. Mary's Church, Reading, 1557:Item, payed to the Mynstrels and the Hobby~horse on May Day, 3s.As time went by, the name hobby-horse was given to numerous other things. For example, A loose woman or strumpet: William Shakespeare, Loves Labour's Lost, 1588 - "Cal'st thou my love Hobbi-horse?"A child's nursery toy: George Puttenham, The Arte of English Poesie, 1589 - "King Agesilaus, hauing a great sort of little children... tooke a little hobby horse of wood and bestrid it to keepe them in play."A dance, similar to the stage antics of the mummers' horses: Richard Lassels, The Voyage of Italy, circa 1668 - "Women like those that danced anciently the Hobby-horse in Country Mummings."A favourite pursuit or pastime - later shortened of course just to hobby:Sir Matthew Hale, Contemplations Moral and Divine, 1676 - "Almost every person hath some hobby horse or other wherein he prides himself."A wooden horse fixed on a ‘merry-go-round’:Gray's Letters and Poems, 1741 - "A Fair here is not a place where one eats gingerbread or rides upon hobby-horses."A velocipede, on which the rider proceeded by pushing the ground with each foot alternately; also called a 'Dandy-horse':The Gentleman's Magazine, February 1819 - "A machine denominated the Pedestrian Hobby-horse... has been introduced into this country by a tradesman in Long Acre."It is the 'favourite pastime' version of the name, what we now call simply 'a hobby', that was adopted as a figurative expression meaning 'a fixation; a thing one keeps coming back to', i.e. similar to having a bee in one's bonnet.So, a hobby is really a hobby-horse. If by any chance you occupy your spare time studying 13th century Irish livestock, your hobby-horse might just be a Hobby horse.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it Meaning If something is working adequately well, leave it alone. Origin Humans seem to have the urge to improve things. Prehistoric hand-axes were made by repeatedly chipping small flakes off pebbles of flint with other hard objects. Million-year-old examples of these have been found that give the impression of being ruined by being chipped just one time too many. That pang of regret we have probably all felt after spoiling something by adding that unnecessary final touch was first faced by Ugg in his cave. The thought may be Stone Age but the phrase 'if it ain't broke don't fix it', which sounds as though it might come from the Roosevelt or Truman era, is even more recent than that - and it's nice for a change to be able to give an expression a precise date. This one was first uttered by T. Bert (Thomas Bertram) Lance, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in Jimmy Carter's 1977 administration. He was quoted in the newsletter of the US Chamber of Commerce, Nation's Business, May 1977: Bert Lance believes he can save Uncle Sam billions if he can get the government to adopt a simple motto: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." He explains: "That's the trouble with government: Fixing things that aren't broken and not fixing things that are broken." George Bernard Shaw's 'two countries divided by a common language' comes into play here. The phrase has to be American. In England things don't get broke, they get broken. When websites ask 'Forgot Your Password?' I always mutter "No, but I have forgotten it". In a few short years, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' has, even in the UK, become so established a part of the language as to have become a cliché, which is an unusually quick ascent and descent. Nevertheless, it's a close call as to whether Lance is now best remembered as coining that phrase or for William Safire's pithy description of him as 'Carter's broken Lance' after his resignation in 1977, following the Calhoun National Bank corruption scandal.

Without so much as a by your leaveMeaningWithout even asking for permission.Origin'Without so much as a by your leave' is an old phrase but is still often used when someone, who might have been expected to have asked permission first, is disapproved of for acting on their own authority. The expression began life in the early 19th century. The first mention that I can find of a version in print is from The New-England Magazine Volume 3, September 1832:The evil creature [a mosquito] ... lit upon my forehead. Already he had inserted his atrocious tube, and was drawing blood, without so much as the civility of By your leave.An example of the precise current version came a few years later, in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Volume 51, 1842:"You [an itinerant peasant] have taken a place by our fire, without so much as a 'by your leave'". This expression is an unusual example of a phrase made from two separate phrases. The form 'without so much as...' has been used since the 16th century to indicate that someone had failed to do something that they had been expected to do. For example, this piece from The Countesse of Pembrokes Arcadia, by Sir Philip Sidney, 1590:Lifting his feete aboue his head, making a great deale of salt water to come out of his mouth, they layd him vpon some of their garments... At length, opening his eyes, he gaue a great groane... Hee (without so much as thanking them for their paines) gate vp. [got up] Before we can decipher what 'without so much as a by your leave' means, we also need to understand 'by your leave'. I have to admit that, as a callow youth and when my mother used this phrase, I though it was 'without a by or leave', not really knowing what a 'by' or a 'leave' might be. Perhaps I should have been quicker on the uptake, as 'by your leave' was commonly heard in 1950s swashbuckling 'tights and knights' B-feature movies, just as 'shiver me timbers' was drawled by yo-ho-ho screen pirates. Nevertheless, unlike that nautical expression, which was probably the invention of a landlubber author, 'by your leave' is an authentic mediaeval colloquial phrase. It derives simply from the mediaeval meaning of 'leave', i.e. 'permission'. To 'ask leave' of someone wasn't to request to depart their presence but to ask permission of them to do something and, as it would only be asked of someone who had the power to grant or bar such permission, it was often expressed as 'by your leave, sire'. That may be the association that has caused another misstated version of it, as 'by your liege'. 'Leave' has been used with the meaning of permission since at least the 9th century. It was still commonplace in Shakespeare's day and he used it numerous times in his plays, for example, in The Merchant of Venice, 1596:Shylock: I pray you give me leave to go from hence.Very soon after that comes the first example of 'by your leave' that I can find in print, in Henry Buttes' Dyets drie dinner, 1599:(by thy leaue) Ile be a Guest of thine.

On the ballMeaningTo be alert; in command of one's senses. OriginSome authorities have suggested that 'on the ball' originated in the sporting arena, and alludes to runners being on the balls of their feet, eagerly ready to run a race. This has some similarities with being 'up to scratch', which derives from boxers or runners being ready at the starting line. It is a plausible derivation, but has nothing to recommend it beyond that. A more commonly advocated location for the source of 'on the ball' is the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. This is where the oldest surviving and best known time-ball is sited. The Greenwich time-ball was installed in 1833 to signal the accurate time to passing ships. It was, and still is, raised just before 1pm each day and falls as 1pm strikes on the observatory's clock. Captains needed to have their ships' chronometers set accurately in order to navigate correctly, hence they needed to be 'on the ball'. It's a nice story and there are any number of tour guides around the observatory who are all too happy to repeat it. Unfortunately...Need I go on? It isn't true. The phrase 'on the ball' did actually originate in the sporting arena, but relates to the eyes rather than the feet. It is a contraction of the earlier expression 'keep your eye on the ball', which advice has been given to participants in virtually every known ball game. For the source, we need to look to early ball games. The phrase is recorded in early records of cricket, golf, croquet and baseball and many people regard baseball as the origin. Well, that appears to be almost true - the earliest citation that I can find in print comes from the English game of rounders. The English novelist William Kingston wrote 'books for boys', and in 1864 published Ernest Bracebridge, or, Schoolboy Days, which includes this scene:Ellis seized the bat with a convulsive clutch... Remembering Ernest's advice, he kept his eye on the ball, and hit it so fairly that he sent it flying away to a considerable distance. "Capital!" cried Ernest. "Run! run! - two bases at least."American readers will recognise the similarity of the rounders terminology with that of baseball. For those not familiar with rounders and/or baseball, suffice it to say that they are essentially the same game, but that it is easier to imagine Sylvester Stallone playing baseball. There's no consensus on this but there's a strong case to be made that baseball is in fact an English game, being merely a beefed-up variation of rounders. In 1744, which is certainly before anyone is known to have played baseball in the USA, John Newbery, an English publisher and a man with a reasonable claim to be the originator of literature printed specifically for children, produced A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, intended for the Amusement of Little Master Tommy and Pretty Miss Polly. That title sounds entirely suitable as the source of the rules of the game of rounders, which is played nowadays by children. Nevertheless, the book includes a graphic labelled Base-Ball, which shows men playing the game and which is accompanied by a rhyme that pretty much sums up the basics of both rounders and baseball:The ball, once stuck off,Away flies the boyTo the next destin'd post,And then home with joy.Baseball may or may not have been the origin of 'keep your eye on the ball', but it did take over the use of the phrase. As well as as the batters 'keeping their eye on the ball', the pitchers were also said to 'put something on the ball', i.e. they imparted some spin or curve on it. This usage dates from the start of the 20th century, for example, this piece from The Indianapolis Star, April 1910:Graham put something on the ball that fooled even Bowerman.The figurative version of the phrase 'on the ball', i.e. with the meaning of being 'alert or apt' in a context where no actual ball is present, began later still. In 1989, W. C. Williams and J. Laughlin published Selected Letters, which contained an extract from a letter written Williams in 1939:The novella by Quevedo... [is] right on the ball.

High on the hogMeaningAffluent and luxurious.OriginThe source of this phrase is often said to be the fact that the best cuts of meat on a pig come from the back and upper leg and that the wealthy ate cuts from 'high on the hog', while the paupers ate belly pork and trotters. The imagery of lords and ladies feasting on fine meats, done to a turn, at Olde Englyshe banquets is easy to bring to mind and this seems to be the right context for the phrase to have been coined in. However, as far as the source of this expression goes, our imagination needs to leap forward a few centuries. None of the variants of the phrase 'living (or eating) high on (or off) the hog' is to be found in any of the works of Chaucer, Shakespeare or the like. In fact, they aren't found in print in any form until the 20th century, and then in the USA rather than England. 'High' has been in used in the UK with the meaning 'impressive; superlative; exalted' since the 17th century and in the USA since the early 19th century. For example, this from Samuel Pepys Diary or, as he liked to call it, Samuel Pepys' Memoirs - Comprising his Diary, in the entry for 29th July 1667:"Where it seems people do drink high."The word alluded to people's status and is the source of the terms 'high-life' (18th century), 'high-table' (15th century) and even 'high-heaven' (9th century).The idea that 'living high on the hog' initially meant 'living the high life' and eating pork, rather than literally 'eating meat from high on the pig', seems plausible but is dealt a blow by the following citation. This is the earliest printed form of the phrase that I have come across - from the New York Times, March 1920:Southern laborers who are "eating too high up on the hog" (pork chops and ham) and American housewives who "eat too far back on the beef" (porterhouse and round steak) are to blame for the continued high cost of living, the American Institute of Meat Packers announced today.'High off the hog' has a similar pedigree, i.e. mid 20th century USA. For example, the San Francisco paper the Call-Bulletin, May 1946:I have to do my shopping in the black market because we can't eat as high off the hog as Roosevelt and Ickes and Joe Davis and all those millionaire friends of the common man. Why, when people had eaten pork for millennia, did the phrase not originate before the 20th century, is a difficult question to answer. Nevertheless, 'high on the hog' appears to have been derived, in the USA, as a reference to the cuts of meat on pigs. The question of why the clunky idiom 'eating too far back on the beef' didn't quite catch on with the public is a little easier to resolve.

In spadesMeaningIn abundance; very much. OriginIt's easy to believe that this expression derives from the imagery of digging with spades and that 'in spades' is just short for 'in spadefuls'. However, the spades concerned here aren't the garden tools but the suit of cards. Hearts and Spades are the higher ranking suits in the game of Contract Bridge, a very popular pastime in the USA in the early 20th century, which is when and where the phrase originated. Despite the agricultural-sounding name and the shovel-like shape, the suit in cards has nothing directly to do with garden spades. Playing Cards originated in Asia and spread across Europe around the 14th century, arriving in England a little later than in Spain, Italy and Germany.The Italian versions of early cards used the suits Cups, Swords, Coins and Batons, which, on migration to England, became Hearts, Spades, Diamonds and Clubs. The image for Spades on English and French cards looks somewhat like that of the German Acorn or Leaf suits, but its origin is revealed by its name rather than its shape. The Spanish and Italian for sword is 'espado' and 'spado' respectively, hence the suit 'Swords' became anglicized as 'Spades'.We have been 'calling a spade a spade' for many centuries, but the expression 'in spades' is a 20th century US coinage. The term was often used before that in relation to card games, where Bridge contracts might be entered into in the minor suits of Clubs or Diamonds or, for the higher scores, 'in Hearts' or 'in Spades'. The figurative meaning, i.e. the non-cards-related 'very greatly' meaning, isn't found before the 1920s. The American journalist and writer Damon Runyon used the expression that way in a piece for Hearst's International magazine, in October 1929:"I always hear the same thing about every bum on Broadway, male and female, including some I know are bums, in spades, right from taw."It isn't possible to be sure that the figurative 'in spades' derives from Bridge - we don't say 'in hearts' after all, but the coincidence of the time and place of the origin of the expression and the popularity of the card game certainly does suggest a connection. See also: Grand Slam.

On the buttonMeaningJust right; exactly on target or at exactly the right time.OriginThe Vancouver Winter Olympics have provoked a rash of emails asking if 'on the button' derives from the sport of Curling. In curling, which has a Scots sub-language all of its own, the centre of the target (a.k.a. 'house') is called the button. The object is to get the stones as near as possible to the middle of the target, so being 'on the button' at the end of a game is clearly no bad thing. The sport has an ancient enough pedigree to have spawned the odd phrase as well as its jargon words, as it originated in Scotland in the 1600s and it would be pleasing to find a Scottish phrase that wasn't coined by Sir Walter Scott. Regrettably, 'on the button' is a 20th century phrase and from the USA. It is from a sporting context, but from boxing rather than curling. The 'button' in question is the US slang term for the point of the chin. The phrase started being used around the end of WWI and there are many printed citations of 'the champ was socked on the button' etc. from that period. The earliest citation of the phrase that I have found is from the impressively named Indiana newspaper The Logansport Pharos-Reporter, May 1917:Moran is a one-punch fighter. He packs a mighty mean crusher in his right hand. If it ever lands on the button Morris will prove himself a superman if he doesn't go down.The precise location of the button was made clear in Harry Witwer's screenplay for the 1921 boxing film The Leather Pushers:The Kid floored him with a right cross to the button of the jaw. P. G. Wodehouse, a frequent visitor to the USA, took up the phrase and introduced it to the UK, as in his novel Laughing Gas, 1936, for example:He soaked [socked] him on the button, don't you know.Before long the term began to be used to mean 'accurately; precisely' and came to refer to times as well as locations. An early example of that is found in Printers' Ink Monthly, May 1937:On the button, a program ending exactly on time.The interest in the possible curling-related source of 'on the button' has come about because of the media interest in the much-fancied British team and their chances of a gold medal in the Winter Olympics. It's no surprise that, with personnel with names like Ewan MacDonald, David Murdoch etc., the British team is really the Scottish team. That's only so long as they are winning though. Having lost to Sweden, the English newspapers have stopped referring to 'our boys', who can now enjoy being Scottish again.

Lark aboutMeaningPlay the fool, in a childish or careless manner.OriginThere are several possible derivations of the word 'lark' in this context. 'Larking about' or 'lark about' (sometimes used as 'larking around' or 'lark around') has been used to mean 'getting up to mischief; playing the fool' since at least the middle of the 19th century. At source its origins may well be somewhat earlier than that; how much earlier depends on which of the proposed origins proves to be correct. The principal theories are that either: 'Larking' derives from the Yorkshire dialect word 'lake', meaning 'to amuse oneself'. For example, in a book by William of Palerne, circa 1350:[He] layked him long while to lesten at mere. [listen to merriment] 'The Yorkshire pronunciation of 'lake' sounds like 'laik', which could be mistaken for 'lark' outside the county. or:'Larking' derives from 'skylark' and alludes to the well-known aerial acrobatics of the European Skylark. When they are on the ground these inconspicuous little birds look like what birdwatchers disparagingly call SBJs - 'small brown jobs'. In the air and singing they are transformed into one of nature's wonders - spiralling upward and trilling an exquisite song. Of course, skylarks were the inspiration for the UK's favourite piece of classical music - Ralph Vaughn Williams' The Lark Ascending. They also appear to have inspired sailors to describe lads who played around in the rigging of ships as skylarks. This term appears to have been coined with reference to the earlier name 'mudlarks' - the children who played and scavanged about the shoreline.  Skylarks were first defined in a rather unlikely source, The Student's Comprehensive Anglo-Bengali Dictionary, Kanta, 1802: Skylarking, the act of running about the rigging of a vessel in sport; frolicking.The use of 'lark' as a verb begins soon after that, as in an entry for 1813 in the diary of Lieutenant Colonel Peter Hawker:"Having larked all the way down the road."The first mention that I can find of 'larking about' in print comes from an edition of the American magazine The Living Age, 1844:One of the young genelmen was called Mr. Larkins, and I'm blessed but the name he hailed by tallied exactly with the cast of his figure-head and the trim of his craft, for he was eternally larking about somut or other, and his very face displayed a mixture of fun and mischief. Of the two theories presented above, it does seem that the 'skylarking' origin is by far the more likely.Whatever the origin, 'larking' may well have been the source of the term 'larrikin', i.e. 'hooligan; rowdy young fellow' (although there are other theories on that too). Fred Jago's Ancient Language and Dialect of Cornwall, 1882, includes this definition:Larrikins, mischievious young fellows, larkers. The term migrated to Australia and New Zealand and was in widespread use there in the 19th century. In the same way that a current UK term for rowdies - 'lads', has led on to female rowdies being called 'ladettes', polite Victorian society down under often complained about the excesses of 'larrikinesses'. Joseph Wright's Supplement to the English Dialect Dictionary, 1905, cites Warwickshire and Worcestershire sources that defined larrikin as 'a mischievous or frolicsome youth'. While the English West Midlands may not have been the source of the term, the common use of it there no doubt influenced the choice of name of Jethro Larkin, a character in The Archers, the BBC's long-running soap opera (sorry, 'Radio drama'), which is set in that region.

A complete shamblesMeaningA scene of disorder; a ruin; a mess. OriginJournalists today are hyperbolical - and I don't mean they have taken to studying conic sections; but they do like to hype things up. Nothing is ever new, it is brand new and more often brand spanking new. Likewise, the nice little word 'shambles' is now almost always accompanied by one of the intensifiers 'total' or 'complete'. That intensification began around the middle of the 19th century - for example, this piece from the English literary journal Bentley's Miscellany, 1846:I stepped onto her decks; they were a complete shambles, a dozen or more men lay about the after part of the ship.Note the link between 'shambles' and blood and gore - more on that later. Many newspaper stories in the UK in early 2010 have had occasion to refer to shambles. The accounts of the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile have described the cities of Port-au-Prince and Conception as 'a total shambles', 'a complete shambles' etc. It has also been reported that The Shambles area of York has been voted 'Britain's most picturesque street'. Even there, shambles wasn't allowed out alone, as the Daily Mail's report on Google's Street View Awards, March 2010:"Britain's most picturesque street is a complete Shambles"What's going on here? The same newspapers are using 'shambles' to describe 'the worst of cities' and 'the best of cities'. Oddly enough, for two apparent polar extremes, the 'devastated' shambles and the 'pretty' shambles derive from the same source. More oddly still, that source is a small wooden bench.As early as AD825 there is a documentary record of the Old English word 'scomul' [later called shamble], meaning 'footstool'. By AD971 this had been recorded as meaning 'bench for the sale of goods' and by 1305 'stall for the sale of meat'. Here's where York comes into it. The introduction to a 1410 copy of the text of the York Mystery Plays makes reference to a dispute between various crafts guilds in the town. Candlemakers were up in arms complaining that other guilds were muscling in on their territory and selling candles without a licence. The text is long and difficult to decipher, but the important point from our perspective is that it makes specific mention of York's 'Flesshchameles', ['flesh shambles'], i.e. 'stalls selling meat'. Other English towns also had 'shambles' meat markets, for example Nottingham, as is recounted in The Records of the Borough of Nottingham, 1484:The twychell betwix ye Shaumelles and ye Draperie [The narrow lane between the meat market and the clothes shops]. Go to York today and you will find the narrow lanes of The Shambles to be bustling with tourists and shoppers. In the Middle Ages it must have been mayhem, the streets crammed full with stalls of all manner of trades - in addition to the Shambles' bouchers, the 1413 Register of the Freemen of York lists wevers, cordwaners, bakesters, glovers, fysshmangers and many more. It isn't surprising that 'shambles' became a byword for chaos and disorder. It had become established as such by the 17th century and, in 1617, Fynes Moryson wrote a travelogue of his experiences in European countries, making this comment on Venice: There is the Pallace of a Gentleman, who proving a Traytor, the State (for his reproch) turned the same into a shambles.A shamble, beginning as a humble stool, took a step by step linguistic journey to become a ruin, and that's the shambles of earthquake zones that we have become all too familiar with. The Shambles in York, once a stinking meat market, headed in another direction and is now an model of Olde Englyshe charm.

Lock, stock and barrelMeaningThe whole thing.OriginI've seen it suggested that this phrase refers to all of a shopkeeper's possessions - the stock in trade, the items stored in barrels and the lock to the door. This explanation is entirely fanciful though - the 'whole thing' in question when this phrase originated was a musket. Muskets were composed of three parts:- The lock, or flintlock, which is the firing mechanism. Various forms of 'lock' muskets were used from the 1400s onwards, e.g. firelocks, flintlocks, matchlocks etc. The term 'lock' was probably adopted because the mechanism resembles a door lock. - The stock, which is the wooden butt-end of the gun. 'Stock' is the old term for wooden butt or stump and is a generic term for a solid base. It was used as early as 1495 in association with Tudor guns, in a bill for 'gonne stokkes'. See also laughing stock. - The barrel, i.e. a cylindrical object, is an even older word and was well-established by the 15th century. This is the least obvious of these three terms to have been chosen to name a musket part. After all, in the 15th century people would have been very familiar with barrels as the squat coopered tubs used for storage - hardly similar to the parallel-sided cylindrical tubes that were used in muskets. It may have been that the term migrated from cannons or other sorts of gun which were more barrel-shaped. Note: that 'lock, stock and barrel' refers to muskets, not rifles. What makes rifles different from earlier guns are the spiral grooves inside the barrel, which cause the bullet to rotate and fly more truly. 'Rifle' derives from the French verb 'rifler' - to scratch or scrape. Note again: that some make a distinction between spirals (i.e. coiling around a fixed point - like a watch-spring) and helixes (i.e. advancing around an axis - like a corkscrew). If you prefer such nicety then your rifle's grooves are helicoid not spiral. Given the antiquity of the three words that make up the phrase and the fact that guns have been in use since at least the Hundred Years' War in 1450, and even earlier in other countries e.g. China, we might expect it to be very old. In fact it isn't particularly; the earliest use of it appears to come from around the beginning of the 19th century. The reason for the weasly 'around' is the difficulty of separating the literal uses of 'lock, stock and barrel' from the figurative uses that don't refer directly to guns. For example, the earliest use of the phrase that I have found is from James Ray's A Compleat History of the [Jacobite] Rebellion, 1752:...she found my Highland Pistols, which were a Piece of curious Workmanship, the Stock, Lock and Barrel being of polish'd Steel.Calling that usage a phrase is stretching reality thin; it is more a form of words and certainly not a metaphorical reference to 'the whole thing'. Such grouping together of 'stock' and 'lock' and 'barrel' does lay the groundwork for their adoption as a single unit, i.e. a phrase; an example of that is found in the USA in July 1803 in The Connecticut Centinel. The newspaper included a letter that reported on a celebration of the 4th of July, in the town of Stratford. The 30 men present carried a 'huge keg of rum' around the town and then drank toasts with 'full bumpers' [glasses filled to the brim] to:1st: The 4th of July, 1776, the birthday of our ninepence... 2nd: Jefferson, Paine, Gallatin and all the rest... [...]6th: Patriotism - Self interest, the cock, lock, stock and barrel.[and so on...] After the 13th toast the records peter out, remarking that the company was 'over zealous' and 'celebrated all night'. The participants might have been 'feeling no pain' and possibly recalled little detail the next morning, but the writer seems to have noted the events precisely. His usage is clearly figurative rather than literal and as such is the earliest use of the phrase that I am aware of. The inclusion of 'cock' [the firing hammer] lends additional weight to the argument that the allusion is to firearms. The colloquial use and lack of any explanation suggests that the phrase was in circulation in the USA in 1803 and earlier citations may well be found. Rudyard Kipling came close to giving us a definition of the term in 1891, in Light That Failed:"The whole thing, lock, stock, and barrel, isn't worth one big yellow sea-poppy."

Bite the bulletMeaningAccept the inevitable impending hardship and endure the resulting pain with fortitude.OriginI've always believed that, before the days of effective anaesthetics, soldiers were given bullets to bite on to help them endure pain. 'I've always believed' has to be as poor an opening gambit as 'it is widely accepted' or 'a man in a pub told me' on a piece discussing the origins of a phrase.Is it true or is it just 'believed'? The theory goes that patients undergoing surgery would be given a stick of wood or a cloth to bite on in order to concentrate their attention away from the pain and also to protect against biting their own tongues. A bullet, being somewhat malleable and not likely to break the patient's teeth, is said to have been an impromptu battlefield alternative. Lead poisoning would probably have been a secondary concern in those circumstances. Many artists, notably Rembrandt Van Rijn and Hieronymus Bosch, painted scenes of early surgery and none of those paintings shows patients biting into anything. Whether or not they might have been offered anything to nibble on, there's little doubt that they would have been fortified with strong drink. The most frequently cited origin of the alleged 'biting the bullet' practice is the American Civil War. This seems rather improbable, as effective anaesthesia using ether and chloroform was introduced in 1846/47 and ether was issued to U.S. military surgeons as early as 1849 - well before the US Civil War began in 1861. The photograph to the right shows, albeit not too clearly, a patient undergoing amputation in a US Civil War field hospital, with a cloth, presumably soaked in ether/chloroform, held near his mouth. It doesn't look like much fun but, given the choice, and apparently they were, surely patients would prefer unconsciousness to bullet chewing. On the other hand (isn't there always an other hand?), there is a documentary record of an interview with a Mr. Fergusson in the literary magazine The West of England Miscellany, Volume 1, Issue 1, 1844: The instant chance of being killed, in fact, and never more seeing Mrs. Ferguson, was eminently disagreeable to me. I shook a little, I confess, and bit the bullet-end of my cartridge, saying my prayers of course, the first time for ten years.That may well be a fictional account rather than an actual battlefield memory, but it does place the literal usage of 'bit the bullet' in 1844 and I can find no earlier example. It refers to an attempt to allay fear rather than pain. It seems unlikely that surgical patients ever bit bullets. However, it doesn't have to have been a description of something that actually happened for a phrase to pass into metaphorical use; the belief that it referred to some real practice would be sufficient. Rudyard Kipling wrote a dialogue in the 1891 novel The Light That Failed, which uses the expression figuratively (there is no actual bullet involved in the scene), but which appears to allude to the idea, real or invented, that fortitude can be gained by biting a bullet: 'Steady, Dickie, steady!' said the deep voice in his ear, and the grip tightened. 'Bite on the bullet, old man, and don't let them think you're afraid.'By 1926, the phrase had left the gory battlefields of the Boer War far behind and moved into the drawing rooms of the English upper classes, in the voice of Bertie Wooster, speaking to Jeeves in The Inimitable Jeeves, 1923:Brace up and bite the bullet. I'm afraid I've bad news for you.My 'always believed that' is now looking distinctly shaky - time for me to bite the bullet and accept the inevitable I think.

Hard linesMeaningBad luck.OriginA line can be many things - a cord or string, a linear mark, a short letter, a policy, a range of retail goods, and so on. Given that, and the fact that 'hard lines' isn't obviously derived from any one of them, the door is open for the merchants of conjectural etymology. Clearly the derivation of 'hard lines' is entirely dependent on which line was being referred to when the phrase was coined. There is a reference to lines in the King James Version of the Bible, 1611, and that is the basis of several early citations of 'hard lines':Psalms 16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.'Lines' here is generally interpreted to mean the demarkation of land for the building of a house. In 1866, the American writer John Greenleaf Whittier, in a prose work entitled Margaret Smith's Journal, wrote:My brother's lines have indeed fallen unto him in a pleasant place.The context of that piece is a woman's admiration her brother's new home and it's clear that it alluded to the earlier biblical phrase. Another suggested derivation of 'hard lines' is that the lines are those of a ship, i.e. ropes. For an example we can turn to Sir Walter Scott, an inveterate phrase coiner and frequent flyer on these pages, in the novel Redgauntlet, 1824:The old seaman paused a moment. 'It is hard lines for me', he said, 'to leave your honour in tribulation'.The nautical association is strengthened by the fact that 'hard line money' was paid to seamen in the 19th century and this was referred to explicitly in the August 1886 edition of the London newspaper The Pall Mall Gazette:On a Torpedo-boat, besides, there is hard-line money, which makes up for a good many discomforts.Both of the above explanations make sense, as etymological guesses often do, but neither is the origin of the phrase. The 'lines' in question here are comments written or said about someone. 'Hard lines' began to be used in the late 1600s and was a reference to unwelcome disparaging comments. The earliest example I have found is this piece of strangled verse by Mr. John Cleveland, from his Works, 1687: When sage George Withers and grave William PrynHimself might for a poets share put in;Yet then could write with so much art and skill,That Rome might envy his Satyrick quill,And crabbed Persius his hard lines give o'er,And in disdain beat his brown desk no more.This is somewhat difficult to interpret but another example comes from The History of France, 1702, in which the meaning is more obvious:The innocency of the Princes was declared and published, while the Duke on the contrary was detested as an execrable murderer. These were hard lines to the Duke, who wrote his complaints to the King.The progression from a written or spoken opinion about a person which showed them in a bad light to 'bad luck, old chap' requires no great linguistic leap. 'Hard lines' isn't used so often in everyday speech these days. Fifty years ago, when hearing about a friend's misfortune, we might have bucked them up with 'hard lines chum'; twenty years ago, it might have been 'hard cheese'. These days, the young seem to prefer 'that's a bit harsh'.

Life begins at fortyMeaningLife begins to be better in one's middle age. OriginThe notion that 'life begins at forty' is a 20th century one; prior to that it was more accurate to say 'death begins at forty' as most people didn't live much beyond that age. Life expectancy in mediaeval England was around 25 years and only reached forty sometime around the turn of the 20th century. By the 1930s many, in western societies at least, could expect a decent spell of reasonably affluent retirement, free from work and the responsibilities of childcare. Household gadgets like washing machines and vacuum cleaners were becoming more widely used and had begun to relieve women's drudgery and offer them increasing amounts of leisure time as compared to their Victorian mothers. In 1932, the American psychologist Walter Pitkin published the self-help book Life Begins at Forty. Pitkin stated confidently: Life begins at forty. This is the revolutionary outcome of our New Era. Today it is half a truth. Tomorrow it will be an axiom.Pitkin is often attributed with coining the phrase and, while it is true that his popular book was the cause of it becoming part of the language, he wasn't the first to express the idea, or even the phrase itself. The take-up of the idea was rapid and 'life begins at forty' appears many times in newspapers and other printed records from 1932 onwards. This was propelled further into the American consciousness in 1937 via a recording of the song 'Life begins at Forty', written by Yellen and Shapiro and sung by Sophie Tucker.However, we need to go back a way to find the origin of the phrase. The great 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer came close to it with his view:"The first forty years of life give us the text: the next thirty supply the commentary."In keeping with the reduction of the toil of domestic work and child rearing that began freeing up women's free time to some extent at the start of the 20th century, the first reference to life beginning at forty refers specifically to women. Mrs. Theodore Parsons was Physical Director of Schools in Chicago and, in 1912, wrote Brain Culture Through Scientific Body Building. It wasn't a runaway best-seller, but the arrival of the USA in the First World War in 1917 gave her views a new lease of life. In April of that year The Pittsburgh Press printed a feature on Mrs. Parsons and her no-nonsense opinions about the benefits of a brisk exercise programme that she acquired from her soldier husband (Mr. Theodore Parsons was, sadly, recently deceased - presumably from exhaustion): "The average woman does not know how to breathe, sit, stand or walk. Now I want women to train for the special duties which may devolve upon them in war time. Death begins at thirty, that is, deterioration of the muscle cells sets in. Attention to diet and exercise would enable men and women to live a great deal longer than they do today. The best part of a woman's life begins at forty."What special duties Mrs. Parsons had in mind, stationed as she was in Chicago, isn't clear. The paper was good enough to include a graphic of the dynamic couple, demonstrating their method in action, so you can give it a try and see if it works. Life expectancy has continued to move on and forty now seems no age at all. In 1991, the New York Times printed this opinion: All our age benchmarks, which used to seem solid as rocks, have turned into shifting sands. 'Life begins at 40? More like 60'.

Household wordsMeaningWords or sayings that are in common use; names that are familiar to everyone.OriginWho coined the term 'household words'? The most common answer to any question beginning 'Who coined the phrase ...' is William Shakespeare and, as so often, the bard doesn't disappoint. This one comes from the celebrated Saint Crispin's Day speech in Henry V, 1598:He that shall live this day, and see old age,Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,But he'll remember with advantagesWhat feats he did that day: then shall our names.Familiar in his mouth as household wordsShakespeare was in full creative flow at that date and also coined 'stiffen the sinews', 'like a greyhound in the slips' and 'once more unto the breach' all within the space of a few pages. A 'hold' or 'holding' was the tenure or ownership of a domestic property. This persists in words like 'freehold' and 'smallholding'. 'Household' was the word for things held by a house, i.e. the people and chattels that were normally at home. John Wyclif appears to have been the first person to have set down the word 'household' in print, in his 1382 translation of the Bible, in Ezekiel 28-13:And take pertenaunce of houshold and substaunce.Shakespeare seems to have enjoyed the word 'household' and used it no less than 23 times in his plays - often referring to 'household stuff', by which he meant the Tudor equivalents of bathroom fittings and white goods. Despite his efforts, 'household' didn't take off as a commonly used word and, apart from its use to refer to the Royal household, lay pretty much in the linguistic attic until it was dusted down by another literary giant - Charles Dickens. By 1850, when the magazine Household Words was first published, Dickens was a very successful writer. He had been frustrated by earlier publishing enterprises, in which he thought interference by the publishers had stifled his creativity, and he decided to fund Household Words himself. This gave him free rein to indulge his view that the general public could and should be uplifted by his artistic musings on the stuff of everyday life - hence the title. In the 16th century, the French landowner Michel de Montaigne retired to his chateau to write down and publish his thoughts and inadvertently invented the essay. In the 19th century, the wealthy author Dickens financed a journal to do much the same which also had the effect of bringing the magazine format to the general public. Now we have blogs. Easier and cheaper for us all to have a go, which is excellent - but I can't help feeling that standards have dropped rather.

Going to hell in a handbasketMeaningTo be 'going to hell in a handbasket' is to be rapidly deteriorating - on course for disaster.OriginIt isn't at all obvious why 'handbasket' was chosen as the preferred vehicle to convey people to hell. One theory on the origin of the phrase is that derives from the use of handbaskets in the guillotining method of capital punishment. If Hollywood films are to be believed, the decapitated heads were caught in baskets - the casualty presumably going straight to hell, without passing Go. The first version of 'in a handbasket' in print does in fact relate to an imaginary decapitated head. In Samuel Sewall's Diary, 1714, we find:"A committee brought in something about Piscataqua. Govr said he would give his head in a Handbasket as soon as he would pass it."Sewall was born in England but emigrated to America when he was nine, and this citation reinforces the widely held opinion that the phrase is of US origin. That is almost certainly the case and, even now, 'hell in a handbasket' isn't often used outside the USA. The expression probably had English parentage though. The English preacher Thomas Adams referred to 'going to heaven in a wheelbarrow' in Gods Bounty on Proverbs, 1618:Oh, this oppressor [i.e. one who was wealthy but gave little to the church] must needs go to heaven! What shall hinder him? But it will be, as the byword is, in a wheelbarrow: the fiends, and not the angels, will take hold on him. 'Going to heaven in a wheelbarrow' was a euphemistic way of saying 'going to hell'. The notion of sinners being literally wheeled to hell in barrows or carts is certainly very old. The mediaeval stained glass windows of Fairford Church in Gloucestershire contain an image of a woman being carried off to purgatory in a wheelbarrow pushed by a blue devil. The thought behind the phrase is 17th century, but the precise wording 'going to hell in a handbasket' and its alternative form 'going to hell in a handcart' originated in the US around the middle of the 19th century. The 'handbasket' version is now the more common.'Going to hell in a handbasket' seems to be just a colourful version of 'going to hell', in the same sense as 'going to the dogs'. 'In a handbasket' is an alliterative intensifier which gives the expression a catchy ring. There doesn't appear to be any particular significance to 'handbasket' apart from the alliteration - any other conveyance beginning with 'H' would have done just as well. The similar earlier phrases 'hell in a basket' and 'hell in a wheelbarrow', not having the same catchiness, have now disappeared from common use. Let's launch 'going to hell in a hovercraft' and see if that flies, so to speak.The first example of 'hell in a hand basket' that I have found in print comes in I. Winslow Ayer's account of events of the American Civil War The Great North-Western Conspiracy, 1865. A very similar but slightly fuller report of Morris's comments was printed in the House Documents of the U.S. Congress, in 1867: Speaking of men who had been arrested he [Judge Morris] said, "Some of our very best, and thousands of brave men, at this very moment in Camp Douglas, are our friends; who, if they were once at liberty, would send the abolitionists to hell in a hand-basket." 'Hell in a handcart' is found in print before 'hell in a handbasket'. The earliest citation I can find for that is in Elbridge Paige's book of Short Patent Sermons, 1841:[Those people] who would rather ride to hell in a hand-cart than walk to heaven supported by the staff of industry.

The living daylightsMeaningA person's eyes; more recently, the life force or consciousness. OriginThe release of the 1987 film The Living Daylights, the fifteenth in the James Bond series, reawakened usage of this old phrase. When we refer to someone having the living daylights beaten, scared, or knocked out of them, we just mean that they have been badly beaten or scared, or knocked unconscious. The imagery is of someone being so discomforted as to lose the power of sight. Like similar examples, such as 'beat the stuffing out of', the phrase is often used with an air of exaggeration and not always meant to be taken literally. The original 18th century meaning of 'daylights' was quite specific and literal; it meant 'eyes'. That meaning has now long fallen out of use. The word was occasionally used to denote other items to do with seeing - spectacles, windows etc. (see daylight robbery), but usage of 'daylights' was largely limited to the eyes and to threats to close them by force. The first known citation of the word is one such example, in Henry Fielding's novel Amelia, 1752:"Good woman! I don't use to be so treated. If the lady says such another word to me, d--n me, I will darken her daylights."Francis Grose, in A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1796, reinforces the pugilistic usage: "Plump his peepers, or daylights; give him a blow in the eyes."The 'eyes' meaning of the word was going out of use even in the 19th century, hence the emergence then of 'knocking or beating the daylights out of someone'. The phrase is intended to indicate a severe beating, but perhaps not quite that severe. There was also a later variant of the phrase - 'beat the living daylight out of...'. When referring to eyes, 'daylights' makes sense, whereas the singular 'daylight' doesn't, again indicating that the link between 'eyes' and 'daylights' was becoming defunct. The first usage of 'beating the daylights out' that I can find is in Augustus Peirce's poem The Rebelliad, 1842:The people used to turn about,And knock the rulers' daylights out By the time that the intensifier 'living' was added, the phrase had lost all association with eyes. The earliest known version of that form was printed in several US newspapers in the 1890s, for example, The Decatur Morning Review, September 1890:"'I'm not going to be insulted by a miserable rabbit', and he started to club the living daylights out of the beast with his gun."The 20th century version of the phrase is the American 'punch someone's lights out'. The precursor to this form of the phrase was a widely syndicated newspaper report of the 1956 fight between Sugar Ray Robinson and Carl (Bobo) Olson: "Robinson's knockout punch turned out the lights for Bobo in the second round."

Cheap at half the priceMeaningOf uncertain meaning - see below. OriginBefore we start on this phrase permit me to leap astride my favourite hobby horse for a while. Cheap prices - arghh, no! Price is a numerical measure and, as such, can be high or low but it can't be cheap, any more than it can be green, or hirsute, or pro-communist. Likewise, the phrase that can be heard in most weather forecasts - hot temperatures. No, again; temperature can be high or low, but it can't be hot. Then there's 'fast speeds' and... okay, I'll get off now; let us proceed. 'Cheap at half the price' has joined the list of English phrases that don't convey any useful literal meaning, but which are used in their entirety rather than by being reflected on word by word. Other examples that make little literal sense are 'put your best foot forward', 'head over heels' and, more recently, 'I could care less'. Those like myself, who suffer from literalism, faced with an item offered at half the usual price would expect it to be cheap - what isn't cheap if you halve its price? 'Cheap at twice the price', now there is a bargain. The interpretation of this phrase has caused some debate. I've seen all the positions listed below argued in Phrasefinder Bulletin Board discussions:1. 'Cheap at half the price' is understood to mean 'reasonably priced' and if people understand that meaning why worry about logical niceties? 2. It was never intended to be taken seriously and is a pun on the meaningful phrase 'cheap at twice the price', intended either humorously or in order to deceive. 3. It is just an error made by people who meant to say 'cheap at twice the price' but didn't think hard enough about what they were saying. 'Cheap at half the price' is typical of the street cries of barrow boys. Many of these make no strict sense and stem from the same kind of linguistic exuberance and humour that brought us Cockney rhyming slang. Another theme in barrow boys' calls is the attempt to mislead or at least distract the public and draw their attention away from whatever mild scam the traders might be engaged in. In this way they aren't a million miles away from street magicians who used to use terms like hocus pocus as part of their distraction technique. For example, there's a street cry from the 1940s - 'apples a pound pears'. This makes no sense whatsoever, but sounds as though it ought to. Likewise with 'cheap at half the price'. In the hustle and bustle of a street market it sounds as though the customer is getting a bargain. Given the time to think the phrase through (and who bothers to anyway other than poor sufferers like me?), it is clear that no promise of value for money was made. In a more recent context we now get adverts that offer 'up to 50% or more' of something or other. This makes no sense either, as every quantity is up to 50% or more, thus making it ideal for advertisers - copy that attracts the punters without actually making any explicit promise. 'Cheap at half the price' is by no means recent. Here's an example from The Fort Wayne Daily Sentinel, October 1871:"A New Foundland dog recently sold in this city for $75. He was cheap at half the price."As an example of the confusion this term causes we couldn't do better. Did they intend us to think the dog was inexpensive at $75 or that it would have been had it been sold for $37.50? If I ever open a pet shop I can guarantee a literalist two-for-one offer on budgies- 'cheep at half the price'.

Cotton onMeaningTo get to know or understand something. OriginAs early as 1648, in a pamphlet titled Mercurius Elencticus, mocking the English parliament, the royalist soldier and poet Sir George Wharton used 'cotton', or as it was spelled then 'cotten', as a verb meaning 'to make friendly advances'. 'Cotten up to' and 'cotten on to' were both used to mean 'become friendly with'. Whether this was as a reference to the rather annoying predisposition of moist raw cotton to stick to things or whether it alluded to moving of cotton garments closer together during a romantic advance isn't clear. John Camden Hotten, in his Slang Dictionary, 1869, opted for the former derivation:Cotton, to like, adhere to, or agree with any person; "to COTTON on to a man," to attach yourself to him, or fancy him, literally, to stick to him as cotton would.The number of citations that use 'cottening' in a courtship context and the use of the 'cottening up' variant would suggest the latter is more likely. For example, William Congreave's comic play Love for Love, 1695:I love to see 'em hug and cotten together, like Down upon a Thistle. The attaching of cotton strands to the bobbins of weaving looms is sometimes also cited as a source of 'cottoning on', but there appears to be no basis for that notion. None of the early citations of the phrase mention that context. The 'getting to know someone' meaning is now archaic and has been surplanted by the 'beginning to understand' meaning. 'Cottoning on' as we now use it derives from the meaning of 'attaching oneself to something', specifically an attachment to an idea that we haven't encountered before. This was coined independently from the previous meaning and two centuries later. It would seem to be a reasonable bet that at least one of these two meanings would have been coined in one of the major English-speaking cotton producing regions of the world, for example India or the USA. Not so; the 'become friendly' meaning was established in the UK and the first uses of the 'understand' meaning were in New Zealand and Australia. These do derive from the allusion to sticky cotton bolls. The earliest example that I can find of this is from the New Zealand newspaper The Wanganui Herald, June 1893:The Kaierau forwards are just beginnng to cotton on to the passing game.See also: the meaning and origin of 'cotton-picking'.

Get off your high horseMeaningA request to someone to stop behaving in a haughty and self-righteous manner. Origin'High' has long been a synonym for 'powerful'; 'remote from the common people'. This usage isn't limited to being on one's 'high horse' but has also persisted in terms like 'high and mighty', 'high-handed' and 'high finance' and in job titles like 'high commissioner'. When we now say that people are on their high horse we are implying a criticism of their haughtiness. The first riders of high horses didn't see it that way; they were very ready to assume a proud and commanding position, indeed that was the very reason they had mounted the said horse in the first place. The first references to high horses were literal ones; 'high' horses were large or, as they were often known in mediaeval England, 'great' horses. John Wyclif wrote of them in English Works, circa 1380:Ye emperour... made hym & his cardenals ride in reed on hye ors.Mediaeval soldiers and political leaders bolstered their claims to supremacy by appearing in public in the full regalia of power and mounted on large and expensive horses and, in sculptural form at least, presented themselves as larger than life. The combination of the imagery of being high off the ground when mounted on a great war charger, looking down one's nose at the common herd, and also being a holder of high office made it intuitive for the term 'on one's high horse' to come to mean 'superior and untouchable'. By the 18th century, the use of such visual aids was diminishing and the expression 'mounting one's high horse' migrated from a literal to a figurative usage. In 1782, Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley recorded his Private Sea Journals. These have ultimately failed to live up to their name as, in 1931, they were published by his great, great great grandson: "Whether Sir George will mount his high Horse or be over-civil to Admiral Pigot seems even to be a doubt with himself".Deference to people in positions of power has diminished over the years and we tend nowadays to mock high and mighty people as being 'on their high horse' when they affect a superior and disdainful manner - the term is now rarely used for people who actually are powerful and remote.

Gone for a burton MeaningNo longer functional - a reference to a person who had died or an item that was broken.OriginThere are numerous suggestions as to the origin of this British phrase, and I suppose that is a another way of saying that no one is entirely sure how it originated. It dates from mid 20th century UK and the first reference to it in print is a definition in The New Statesman, August 1941:"Go for a Burton, crash."The source is almost certainly to be the winner of a close-run race between two Burtons; the Staffordshire town of Burton upon Trent, or Sir Montague Burton the tailor - more on them later. The roll call of commonly repeated suggested derivations is quite long, so I'll also list a couple of the long shots: - A burton (also called a Spanish Burton) was a block and tackle mechanism used on Royal Navy ships. It was reputedly complex and difficult to use and any mariner who wasn't where he was expected to be was said to have 'gone for a burton'. 'Burton' is defined in William Falconer's An Universal Dictionary of the Marine, 1769:"Burton, a ... small tackle, formed by two blocks or pulleys ... generally employed to tighten the shrouds of the top-masts." - 'A-burton' was the term used to describe a form of stowage on a ship. Again, we have a definition - in Arthur Young's Nautical Dictionary, 1846:"A-burton, Casks are said to be stowed a-burton, when placed athwartships [from side to side across the ship] in the hold."There really isn't much to commend these explanations apart from the word 'burton'. They are both very early citations for a phrase that wasn't known before the 1940s. Without conclusive proof we can't completely discount them, but it does seem reasonable to put them at the back of the field. That leaves us the two more credible front runners: 1. To 'go for a burton' refers to the beer brewed in the Midlands town of Burton-upon-Trent, which was and still is famous for its breweries. RAF pilots who crashed, especially those who crashed into the sea, i.e. 'in the drink', were said to have 'gone for a burton'. Some commentators have referred to a pre-WWII advert for Burton's Ale, in which a place at table was vacant and the missing person was said to have 'gone for a Burton', i.e. gone to the pub for a drink. That would be a very strong candidate if only any record of the adverts were to be found - and surely they would be evident if they ever existed. Until any do come to light it's reasonable to call the said adverts mythical. 2. 'Go for a burton' is a reference to the suits made by Montague Burton, who supplied the majority of the demobilization suits that British servicemen were given on leaving service after WWII. (Note: Monty is also a contender as the source of the Full Monty). Any serviceman who was absent could have been said to have 'gone for a burton'. This does seem the less likely of the two explanations, as it doesn't quite match the meaning of the phrase. 'Gone for a burton' was used to mean dead, not merely absent, and Montague Burton didn't supply shrouds, as far as I know. What is known for sure is that the term was popularised by the RAF around the time of WWII, evidenced by the fact that all the early citations of it come from that date and context. It migrated to the USA quite quickly and in June 1943 a story entitled Husky Goes Down for a Burton appeared in Boys' Life, the magazine of the Boy Scouts of America:[Gone down for a Burton] In the R.A.F. it's the gentle way of saying that an aviator has been killed in operation.This phrase is now rather archaic and began fading from general use during the later part of the 20th century. It hasn't quite 'gone for a burton' but it is certainly well on its way.

In the nick of timeMeaningJust in time; at the precise moment.OriginThe English language gives us the opportunity to be 'in' many things - the doldrums, the offing, the pink; we can even be down in the dumps. With all of these expressions it is pretty easy to see what they refer to, but what or where is the 'nick of time'? It may not be immediately obvious what the nick of time is, but we do know what it means to be in it, i.e. arriving at the last propitious moment. Prior to the 16th century there was another expression used to convey that meaning - 'pudding time'. This relates to the fact that pudding was the dish served first at mediaeval mealtimes. To arrive at pudding time was to arrive at the start of the meal, just in time to eat. Pudding was then a savoury dish - a form of sausage or haggis (see also the proof is in the pudding). Pudding time is first referred to in print in John Heywood's invaluable glossary A dialogue conteinyng the nomber in effect of all the prouerbes in the Englishe tongue, 1546:This geare comth euen in puddyng time ryghtly. That seems a perfectly serviceable idiom, so why did the Tudors change it to 'the nick of time'? The motivation appears to be the desire to express a finer degree of timing than the vague 'around the beginning of the meal'. The nick that was being referred to was a notch or small cut and was synonymous with precision. Such notches were used on 'tally' sticks to measure or keep score.Note: the expressions 'keeping score' and 'keeping tally' derive from this and so do 'stocks' and 'shares', which refer to the splitting of such sticks (stocks) along their length and sharing the two matching halves as a record of a deal. If someone is now said to be 'in the nick' the English would expect him to be found in prison, the Scots would picture him in the valley between two hills and Australians would imagine him to be naked. To Shakespeare and his contemporaries if someone were 'in (or at, or upon) the (very) nick' they were in the precise place at the precise time. Watches and the strings of musical instruments were adjusted to precise pre-marked nicks to keep them in proper order. Ben Jonson makes a reference to that in the play Pans Anniversary, circa 1637:For to these, there is annexed a clock-keeper, a grave person, as Time himself, who is to see that they all keep time to a nick.Arthur Golding gave what is likely to be the first example of the use of 'nick' in this context in his translation of Ovid's Metamorphosis, 1565:Another thing cleane overthwart there commeth in the nicke: The Ladie Semell great with childe by Jove as then was quicke.The 'time' in 'the nick of time' is rather superfluous, as nick itself refers to time. The first example of the use of the phrase as we now know it comes in Arthur Day's Festivals, 1615:Even in this nicke of time, this very, very instant.

The bee's kneesMeaningExcellent - the highest quality.OriginIt's difficult to know if we need an etymologist or an entomologist for this one.Bees carry pollen back to the hive in sacs on their legs. It is tempting to explain this phrase as alluding to the concentrated goodness to be found around a bee's knee, but there's no evidence to support this explanation. It is also sometimes said to be a corruption of 'business', but there's no evidence to support that either. Nor is there any connection with another earlier phrase, 'a bee's knee'. In the 18th century this was used as a synonym for smallness, but has since disappeared from the language, replaced more recently by the less polite 'gnat's b*****k':[Note: Sorry for the Bowdlerised ***s above. If I included the actual word most email systems would block this mail.}  Mrs. Townley Ward - Letters, June 1797 in N. & Q. "It cannot be as big as a bee's knee."'Bee's knees' began to be used in early 20th century America. Initially, it was just a nonsense expression that denoted something that didn't have any meaningful existence - the kind of thing that a naive apprentice would be sent to the stores to ask for, like a 'sky-hook' or 'striped paint'. That meaning is apparent in a spoof report in the New Zealand newspaper The West Coast Times in August 1906, which listed the cargo carried by the SS Zealandia as 'a quantity of post holes, 3 bags of treacle and 7 cases of bees' knees'. The teasing wasn't restricted to the southern hemisphere. The US author Zane Grey's 1909 story, The Shortstop, has a city slicker confusing a yokel by questioning him about make-believe farm products: "How's yer ham trees? Wal, dog-gone me! Why, over in Indianer our ham trees is sproutin' powerful. An' how about the bee's knees? Got any bee's knees this Spring?"This odd cartoon from the May 5th 1914 edition of the Fort Wayne Sentinel uses the term in exactly the same way: [Text: Now dot I haf adopted Mr Skygack I suppose I haf to feed him. Vot does he eat? He likes bees' knees. Bees' knees? Yes, sure, he is very fond of them. Vell, I guess I got to catch some bees. Diss looks like a bee-hive.]There's no profound reason to relate bees and knees other than the jaunty-sounding rhyme. In the 1920s it was fashionable to use nonsense terms to denote excellence - 'the snake's hips', 'the kipper's knickers', 'the cat's pyjamas/whiskers', 'the monkey's eyebrows' and so on. Of these, the bee's knees and the cat's whiskers are the only ones to have stood the test of time. More recently, we see the same thing - the 'dog's b******s'. [Mr. Bowdler again...]The nonsense expression 'the bee's knees' was taken up by the socialites of Roaring 20s America and added to the list of 'excellent' phrases. A printed reference in that context appears in the Ohio newspaper The Newark Advocate, April 1922, in a piece on newly coined phrases entitles 'What Does It Mean?':"That's what you wonder when you hear a flapper chatter in typical flapper language. 'Apple Knocker,' for instance. And 'Bees Knees.' That's flapper talk. This lingo will be explained in the woman's page under the head of Flapper Dictionary." [an 'apple knocker' is a rustic] Clearly the phrase must have been new then for the paper to plan to take the trouble to define it. Disappointingly, they didn't follow up on their promise and 'the lingo' wasn't subsequently explained. Several U.S. newspapers did feature lists of phrases under 'Flapper Dictionary' headings. Although 'bee's knees' isn't featured, they do show the time as being a period of quirky linguistic coinage. For example, from one such Flapper Dictionary:Kluck - dumb person.Dumb kluck - worse than a kluck. Pollywoppus - meaningless stuff. Fly-paper - a guy who sticks around. One tenuous connection between the bee's knees and an actual bee relates to Bee Jackson. Ms. Jackson was a dancer in 1920s New York and popularised the Charleston, being credited by some as introducing the dance to Broadway in 1924. She went on to become the World Champion Charleston dancer and was quite celebrated at the time. It's not beyond the bounds of possibility that the expression became popular in reference to her and her very active knees, but 1924 post dates the origin of the phrase.

Your name is mudMeaningYou are highly unpopular.OriginIn May 2010, BP tried to cap the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by plugging the leak with heavy mud. Had it worked, it might have given them some hope of limiting the damage to their reputation. As it didn't, the BP brand name is, more literally than most, mud. BP's CEO Tony Hayward has joined another villain of the collective American psyche, Dr. Samuel Mudd, who is widely reviled for his part in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.Dr. Mudd gave medical help to John Wilkes Booth, who broke his leg while escaping after shooting Lincoln in 1865. Mudd was convicted of being Booth's conspirator, although the evidence against him was ambiguous and circumstantial, and many historians argue that he was innocent of any murderous intent. He has since been pardoned and there's even a Facebook site dedicated to salvaging his reputation. Actually, whether Dr. Mudd was innocent or not is of little consequence in regard to the origin of 'your name is mud', as it was in general circulation long before Lincoln was assassinated. This citation comes from John Badcock (a.k.a. 'J. Bee’) in Slang - A Dictionary of the Turf etc., 1823:"Mud - a stupid twaddling fellow. ‘And his name is mud!’ ejaculated upon the conclusion of a silly oration, or of a leader in the Courier."If the phrase wasn't originally 'your name is Mudd', how did it originate? Mud is exhaustively defined in the OED as "soft, moist, glutinous material resulting from the mixing of water with soil, sand, dust, or other earthy matter". The word began to be used in a figurative sense as early as the 16th century to refer to things that were worthless or polluting. That usage was later extended to apply to people, as listed in the 1703 account of London's low life, Hell upon Earth:Mud, a Fool, or thick skull Fellow.For reasons that are difficult to fathom, 'mud' later began to be used as a general intensifier. In the 19th century there are many printed examples of 'as fat as mud', 'as rich as mud', 'as sick as mud' etc. The combination of meanings of 'decaying and worthless' and 'extremely' was enough for the association of it with someone's name to become an insult - hence 'your name is mud'. As something that is at one extreme end of the scale, like 'good' or 'stupid', mud features in many English phrases - 'dragged through the mud', 'mud in your eye', 'as clear as mud' etc. The one that BP has most cause to hope isn't true is 'mud sticks'.

Clutch at strawsMeaningTry any route to get out of a desperate situation, no matter how unlikely it is to succeed.OriginIt is only since the mid-19th century that we have been clutching at straws. Prior to that, desperate people would 'catch at a straw'. That usage of 'catch' was commonly used in mediaeval England, by which was meant 'obtain/achieve'. For example, John Wycliffe used it in his 1382 translation of the Bible into English, in 1 Timothy 6:12:Stryve thou a good strif of feith, catche everlastyng lyf By the 17th century, in the King James Version, this had migrated to:Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal lifeOur present day ambitions are more prosaic and we only use that sense of 'catch' now to catch trains, buses and, occasionally, colds. A straw was chosen as the height of futility as a means of rescue. Being, as it was, a flimsy and virtually valueless waste product, it was often used as a synonym for the most unimportant and trifling of objects. 'Don't give/care a straw' was an indication of indifference, a 'man of straw' was an insubstantial adversary, and to 'condemn someone to straw' was to declare them ready for the madhouse. 'To clutch at straws' is now used as a figurative phrase, to describe any desperate situation. When the expression was coined it specifically referred to drowning. The notion of a drowning man anxiously seeking 'any port in a storm' was first expressed by Sir Thomas More, in A Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation, 1534: A man in peril of drowning catchest whatsoever cometh next to hand... be it never so simple a stick.More used the imagery on several occasions, but didn't mention straw in any of them. The 'catch at a straw' version of the proverb is first recorded in the English cleric John Prime's Fruitful and Brief Discourse, 1583:We do not as men redie to be drowned, catch at euery straw.The metaphor expresses futility rather well. Straws do float, but a drowning man would have to be pretty much out of other ideas if he put any reliance on it bearing his weight. Moving on to the 19th century, 'catch' has fallen from favour and we find an early mention of the current 'clutch at straws' version in The New-York Mirror, 1832:... as drowning men clutch at straws.On to the 21st century and you no longer need to be drowning or desperate to clutch at straws - straw clutch bags have become fashion items.

It ain't over till the fat lady singsMeaningNothing is irreversible until the final act is played out. OriginJust to get this out of the way before we start: is it 'til, till or until? You can find all of these in print:It ain't over 'til the fat lady singsIt ain't over till the fat lady singsIt ain't over until the fat lady singsYou might even find versions with isn't instead of ain't. Grammarians argue about 'til and till; I'm opting here for till. Okay; so who was the fat lady? If we knew that, the origin of this phrase would be easy to determine. Unfortunately, we don't, so a little more effort is going to be required. The two areas of endeavour that this expression is most often associated with are the unusual bedfellows, German opera and American sport. The musical connection is with the familiar operatic role of Brunnhilde in Richard Wagner's Götterdämmerung, the last of the immensely long, four-opera Ring Cycle. Brunnhilde is usually depicted as a well-upholstered lady who appears for a ten minute solo to conclude proceedings. 'When the fat lady sings' is a reasonable answer to the question 'when will it be over?', which must have been asked many times during Ring Cycle performances, lasting as they do upwards of 14 hours. Apart from the apparent suitability of Brunnhilde as the original 'fat lady', there's nothing to associate this 20th century phrase with Wagner's opera. All the early printed references to the phrase come from US sports. Some pundits have suggested that the phrase was coined by the celebrated baseball player and manager, Yogi Berra, while others favour the US sports commentator, Dan Cook. Berra's fracturing of the English language was on a par with that of the film producer Sam Goldwyn but, like those of Goldwyn, many of the phrases said to have been coined by him probably weren't. Along with "It's déjà vu all over again" and "The future isn't what it used to be", Berra is said to have originated "The game isn't over till it's over". All of these are what serious quotations dictionaries politely describe as 'attributed to' Berra, although he certainly did say "You can observe a lot by watching", at a press conference in 1963. In any case, "the game isn't over till it's over" isn't quite what we are looking for, missing as it is the obligatory fat lady.Dan Cook made a closer stab with "the opera ain't over till the fat lady sings", in a televised basketball commentary in 1978. Cook was preceded however by US sports presenter Ralph Carpenter, in a broadcast, reported in The Dallas Morning News, March 1976:Bill Morgan (Southwest Conference Information Director): "Hey, Ralph, this... is going to be a tight one after all."Ralph Carpenter (Texas Tech Sports Information Director): Right. The opera ain’t over until the fat lady sings."It was assumed at the time that Carpenter had coined the term on the spot. Circumstantial evidence is against that assumption. Whilst printed examples of the expression haven't been found that date from before 1976, there are numerous residents of the southern states of the USA who claim to have known the phrase throughout their lives, as far back as the early 20th century. "It ain’t over till the fat lady sings the blues" and "Church ain’t out till the fat lady sings" are colloquial versions that have been reported; the second example was listed in Southern Words and Sayings, by Fabia Rue and Charles Rayford Smith in 1976.Carpenter's and Cook's broadcasts did popularise the expression, which became commonplace in the late 1970s, but it appears that we are more likely to have found the first of the mysterious fat ladies in a church in the Deep South than on the opera stage or in a baseball stadium.

Left in the lurchMeaningAbandoned in a difficult position without help.OriginThis has nothing to do with lurches in the sense of sudden unsteady movements.There are suggestions that lurch is a noun that originated from lich - the Old English word for corpse. Lych-gates are roofed churchyard entrances that adjoin many old English churches and are the appointed place for coffins to be left when waiting for the clergyman to arrive to conduct a funeral service. To be 'left in the lych/lurch' was to be in dire straits indeed. Another theory goes that jilted brides would be 'left in the lych' when the errant bridegroom failed to appear for a wedding. Both theories are plausible but there's no evidence to support either and, despite the superficial appeal of those explanations, 'lych' and 'lurch' aren't related. In fact, the phrase originates from the French board game of lourche or lurch, which was similar to backgammon and was last played in the 17th century (the rules having now been lost). Players suffered a lurch if they were left in a hopeless position from which they couldn't win the game. The card game of cribbage, or crib, also has a 'lurch' position which players may be left in if they don't progress half way round the peg board before the winner finishes.The figurative usage of the phrase had certainly entered the language by the 16th century as this line from Nashe's Saffron Walden, 1596, shows:"Whom he also procured to be equally bound with him for his new cousens apparence to the law, which he neuer did, but left both of them in the lurtch for him."The game came to England from continental Europe and its name derives from the word 'left', which is 'lurtsch' in dialect German and 'loyrtz' in Middle Dutch. Why call a game 'left'? The most plausible explanation (and regular readers will know that, in etymology, plausibility isn't everything) is that it relates to the bad feeling against the left hand that was then commonplace in many cultures. In English we have held on to this with the word 'sinister', which of course just means 'left-handed'.

As pleased as Punch MeaningVery pleased.Origin'As pleased as Punch' derives from the Mr. Punch puppet character. Punch's name itself derives from Polichinello (spelled various ways, including Punchinello), a puppet used in the 16th century Italian Commedia dell'arte. Punch and Judy shows, the popular summer-time entertainments on British beaches, have been somewhat in decline from the latter half of the 20th century onward, due to them being seen as politically incorrect. That's hardly surprising as the main character Punch is a wife-beating serial killer. In performance, the grotesque Punch character is depicted as self-satisfied and delighted with his evil deeds and squawking "That's the way to do it!" whenever he dispatches another victim. Nevertheless, there is still what might be called a folk affection for the old rogue in the UK and it would be a shame to see the tradition fade away completely. The show had an Italian origin and has been much changed over the years. It began in Britain at the time of the restoration of the monarchy in the 17th century. Samuel Pepys' Diary has an entry from 1666 that shows this early origin and also the popularity of the show even then:"I with my wife... by coach to Moorefields, and there saw ‘Polichinello’, which pleases me mightily."The phrase 'as pleased as Punch' appears fairly late in the story. The earliest known record is from William Gifford's satires The Baviad, and Maeviad, 1797:Oh! how my fingers itch to pull thy nose! As pleased as Punch, I'd hold it in my gripe.'As pleased as Punch' is now the most common form of the expression. When the term was coined it was just as usual to say 'as proud as Punch'. Charles Dickens, for example used the two terms interchangeably in his novels. For example: David Copperfield, 1850: I am as proud as Punch to think that I once had the honor of being connected with your family. Hard Times, 1854: When Sissy got into the school here..her father was as pleased as Punch.

Once in a blue moonMeaningVery rarely. OriginAsk the man on the Clapham omnibus the question 'What is a blue moon exactly?' and you are likely to get one of three answers: 1. Duh.2. It's the second full moon in a calendar month.3. It's when the moon looks blue. Let's start with 3. Very occasionally, the moon actually does appear to be blue. This sometimes occurs after a volcanic eruption, like that of Krakatao in 1883. Dust particles in the atmosphere are normally of a size to diffract blue light, making the moon appear reddish at sunset. Larger volcanic dust particles diffract red light, making the moon appear bluish. Tempting as it is to suppose that something that happens very rarely, and which is mentioned by name in a phrase that means 'very rarely', is the source of the phrase, it probably isn't. Actual examples of the moon appearing blue would in fact be the exception that proves the rule, as the 'blue moon' was originally something that was considered not rare but impossible. The two notions, 'a blue moon' and 'the moon is made of green cheese', were synonyms for absurdity, like 'pigs might fly'. The 'blue moon' expression with the 'impossibility' meaning is old and dates back to mediaeval England. For example, a work by William Barlow, the Bishop of Chichester, the Treatyse of the Buryall of the Masse, 1528, included a sarcastic reference to a blue moon:Yf they saye the mone is belewe, We must beleve that it is true.In the following year, John Frith's essay A pistle to the christen reader, 1529, included: "They wold make men beleue... that ye mone is made of grene chese."Only after several centuries, and after the original usage had long since died out, did 'once in a blue moon' come to mean something that didn't happen very often. The earliest example of it that I can find is in Pierce Egan’s Real Life in London, 1821:How’s Harry and Ben? - haven’t seen you this blue moon.Moving on to answer No. 2. To explain that one we have to follow a long trail of etymological research, leading back to an American amateur astronomer called James Pruett.Since 1819, The Maine Farmers' Almanac has listed the dates of forthcoming blue moons. The compilers of the almanac had their own definition of what blue moons are. This derives from the fact that lunar and calendar months aren't quite the same and that some years have 13 full moons. In a typical 12-moon year, the moons all have names, like the familiar 'Harvest Moon', 'Hunter's Moon' etc. In a 13-moon year the extra moon is, somewhat arbitrarily, deemed to be the third moon in the season that has four rather than the usual three, and is called the 'Blue Moon'. The aforementioned James Pruett read an edition of the Maine Farmers' Almanac, but misinterpreted the system and printed the 'second full moon in a month' version in a 1946 edition of the Sky & Telescope Magazine. For some reason, probably because it ended up being printed as an answer in an early version of Trivial Pursuit, Pruett's version has gained currency. Two full moons in a month isn't really all that rare an occurrence - it happens approximately every three years. Despite it being both inaccurate and coined by mistake, Pruett's No. 2 answer is now widely accepted as a definition of 'blue moon'.

Hat trickMeaningA series of three consecutive successes, in sport or some other area of activity.OriginThe sports pages of UK newspapers have been full of hat tricks recently, as there has been a spate of them at the start of the 2010 Premiership Football season. Didier Drogba, playing for Chelsea, narrowly missed out on being the first Premiership player to score a hat trick of hat tricks, i.e. three goals in each of three consecutive games. Those reports refer to players 'scoring a hat trick', but the first hat tricks weren't scored, they were 'taken'. So, where does the term 'hat trick' come from? The first sport to be associated with the term was cricket. From the 1870s onward, 'hat tricks' are mentioned in cricketing literature; for example, this piece from James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual 1877:Having on one occasion taken six wickets in seven balls, thus performing the hat-trick successfully.While that doesn't define what a hat trick is exactly, the arithmeticians amongst you will have noticed that, to take six wickets in seven balls, a bowler has to take at least three consecutive wickets.The theory goes - and there aren't sufficient records to be precise about this - that if a bowler dismissed three batsmen in a row, a collection was taken and the proceeds were used to buy him a new hat. Either that, or a hat was passed round and the bowler trousered the proceeds. That explains 'hat', but why 'trick' exactly? The feat is difficult and is quite a rarity in cricket, there having been only 37 hat tricks in Test cricket history, but 'trick' doesn't seem the obvious word for it. What may well have influenced the choice of words was the sudden popularity of stage conjurers' 'Hat Tricks', which immediately preceded the first use of the term on the cricket field. The magician's Hat Trick, where items, typically rabbits, bunches of flowers, streams of flags etc., are pulled out of a top hat, is well-known to us now but was a novelty in the 1860s. It isn't known who invented the trick. The first reference that I can find to it in print is from Punch magazine, 1858:Professor Willjabber Derby's Clever Hat-Trick. Wiljada Freckel was a clever German conjuror, who produced an infinity of objects from a hat. The trick is accomplished by either using a top hat with a false lid or by sleight of hand. It became something of a fad in Victorian England and, while 'hat trick' wasn't seen in print before 1858, the term appears many times in newspapers throughout the rest of the 19th century. When cricketers in the 1870s wanted to give a name to an impressive achievement that involved a hat, what more obvious name than the currently pervading expression 'hat trick'? The term was also appropriated from the variety stage for the political stage, where Victorian MPs were said to have 'done a hat trick' whenever they reserved their seat in the House of Commons by leaving their top hat on it.

Dog in the mangerMeaningSpiteful and mean-spirited.OriginThe infamous 'dog in a manger', who occupied the manger not because he wanted to eat the hay there but to prevent the other animals from doing so, is generally said to have been the invention of the Greek storyteller Aesop (circa 620-564 BC). Many of the fables that have been credited to Aesop do in fact date from well before the 5th century BC and modern scholarship doesn't give much credence to the idea that Aesop's Fables, as we now know them, were written by him at all. Accounts of Aesop's life are vague and date from long after his death. If he existed at all, it was as an editor of earlier Greek and Sumerian stories rather than as the writer of them. Nothing written by Aesop now exists in any form. Nevertheless, you can go into any bookshop and buy a copy of 'Aesop's Fables' and, for this book more than others, that is largely thanks to the invention of the movable type printing press. Following the production of the Gutenberg Bible in the 1450s, European printers began to look around for other suitable works to print. What better way to educate the common herd than to provide them with the uplifting moral tales of Aesop? The German printer Heinrich Steinhowel set to the task and printed the first German version in 1480. The first English version followed soon after when Caxton adapted the German version into English in 1484.It seems that Steinhowel had decided that Aesop's fables weren't quite uplifting enough and he added the 'Dog in the Manger' in his 1480 version. There's no mention of the story in the Greek descriptions of the fables, some of which date from the 4th century BC. While not being included by Aesop, the story itself is ancient, having been cited in several early Greek texts and in English in John Gower's Confessio Amantis, circa 1390:Though it be not the hound's habitTo eat chaff, yet will he warn offAn ox that commeth to the barnThereof to take up any food.The first specific reference to 'a dog in a manger' is quite old, being first cited in William Bullein's A dialogue against the feuer pestilence, 1564:"Like vnto cruell Dogges liyng in a Maunger, neither eatyng the Haye theim selues ne sufferyng the Horse to feed thereof hymself."'Dog in the manger' is still used allusively to refer to any churlish behaviour of the 'spoilsport' sort. If Google searches are anything to go by, you are just as likely to find it written as 'Dog in the manager', a surreal version that escaped even the inventive Steinhowel.

Pigs might flyMeaningA humourous/sarcastic remark, used to indicate the unlikeliness of some event or to mock the credulity of others. For example, "I might make a start on papering the back bedroom tomorrow". "Yes, and pigs might fly". Origin'Pigs might fly, or as some would have it 'pigs may fly', is an example of an adynaton, that is, a figure of speech that uses inflated comparison to such an extent as to suggest complete impossibility. Other examples are 'It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle...' and 'Make a mountain out of a molehill'. A correspondent recently drew my attention to a book by John Winthrop and wondered if it might be the origin of the expression 'pigs might fly'. Winthrop was an English Puritan explorer who settled in Massachusetts in 1630 and recounted his story in The History of New England, 1630-1649, which was transcribed from Winthrop's 17th century notes and published in 1908:In this year one James Everell, a sober, discreet man, and two others, saw a great light in the night at Muddy River. When it stood still, it flamed up, and was about three yards square; when it ran, it was contracted into the figure of a swine: it ran as swift as an arrow towards Charlton, and so up and down about two or three hours.Whether Everett and his pals had been at the fermented cranberry juice or whether they were the first to record an attempted alien abduction we don't know, but we can be sure that their visions weren't the source of the popular saying. The original version of the succinct 'pigs might fly' was 'pigs fly with their tails forward', which is first found in a list of proverbs in the 1616 edition of John Withals's English-Latin dictionary - A Shorte Dictionarie for Yonge Begynners: Pigs fly in the ayre with their tayles forward.This form of the expression was in use for two hundred years as a sarcastic rejoinder to any overly optimistic prediction made by the gullible, much as we now use "...and pigs might fly". Why pigs? Other creatures were previously cited in similar phrases - 'snails may fly', 'cows might fly' etc., but it is pigs have stood the test of time as the favoured image of an animal that is particularly unsuited to flight. It is probably the bulkiness of the creatures and their habit of rooting in earth that suggests an intensely ramping nature [...and it's nice to have an opportunity to sneak in the little-used 'ramping', which means no more nor less than 'unable to fly'].Thomas Fuller, in Gnomologia, 1732, was the first to explicitly single out the pig as a ham-fisted aeronaut:That is as likely as to see an Hog fly.The first example that I can find of our currently used 'pigs may fly/pigs might fly' form is from The Autobiography of Jack Ketch By Charles Whitehead, 1835:Yes, pigs may fly, but they're very unlikely birds.Having an autobiography that is written by someone else is commonplace in the celebrity-obsessed 21st century, but wasn't in Ketch's day. Ketch was the executioner employed by Charles II and his days were lived out in the 17th century, so, unless our eponymous hangman really was a ghost writer, we have to assume the words of an 'autobiography' written 150 years after his death were Whitehead's rather than his.Flying pigs appeared in print in the UK quite often throughout the rest of the 19th century. The Illustrated Times referred to them in an issue in August 1855:...pigs might fly. An elephant, too, might dance on the tight-rope,Lewis Carroll also conjured one up in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, 1865:"I've a right to think," said Alice sharply... "Just about as much right," said the Duchess, "as pigs have to fly." It can't be long before another correspondent adds to the list of unlikely origins of 'the whole nine yards' and suggests that it derives from Winthrop's 'three yards square' combustible aerial pig.

Cash on the nailMeaningPayment made immediately.Origin'Cash on the nail' (or 'pay on the nail') is an extension of the earlier phrase - 'on the nail', meaning immediate payment; without delay. This expression is first recorded in English in Thomas Nashe's Haue with you to Saffron-Walden, 1596:"Tell me, haue you a minde to anie thing in the Doctors Booke! speake the word, and I will help you to it vpon the naile."Philip Massinger's comic play The City-Madame, 1632, in which a character welcomes the arrival of a ship that has given his master considerable profit, makes the association with timeliness clear:And it comes timely; For, besides a payment on the nail for a manor late purchased by my master, his young daughters are ripe for marriage. The first example that I can find of the longer 'cash on the nail' version is in an anonymous open letter from to the Mayor of Exeter, printed in a sixpenny broadsheet in 1753:The Commanders and Officers of those vessels knew very well that Wool and Worsted were Commodities of a real and intrinsic Value: Articles that would sell at any Time or Place for ready Cash on the Nail. I've managed to get this far without mentioning the story that 'cash on the nail' relates to the bronze pillars called nails. These are to be seen outside the Corn Exchange in Bristol and the Stock Exchanges in Limerick and Liverpool. This derivation is printed in virtually every etymological reference book. Whisper it not in Bristol, Limerick or Liverpool, but this story has to be treated with some caution. It is said that the oldest of the four pillars in Bristol is mid-16th century and so would just pre-date the earliest printed reference to 'on the nail'. It is also true that business deals were sealed on these pillars. The late dates of the appearance of either or the terms cash on the nail and pay on the nail, make the attribution doubtful. None of the early printed references makes any reference to any of the cities with nails. The first time the suggested link between the bronze nails and the phrase was made was in 1870, by Dr Cobham Brewer in the first edition of the Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. That suggestion was made over a century after the phrase was already in common use. There's not quite enough evidence to say that Brewer made the story up, but it does seem to be a strong possibility. It is more likely that the nails were named to match the expression rather than the other way around and that the origin of the expression lies in France rather than on the west coast of either England or Ireland. Versions of the expression were used in several European languages:14th century Anglo-Norman, as payer sur le ungle - to pay immediately.17th century French, as sur l'ongle - exactly.Dutch, as op den nagel - on the nail German, as auf den Nagel - entirely, to the last detail. The Anglo-Norman 'payer sur le ungle' means just the same as the English 'pay on the nail'. 'Ungle' derives from the Latin 'ungula', which means claw or nail. The sense of the earliest version of the phrase is clearly 'payment with the hand' - nothing to do with bronze obelisks. By around 1900 the US also began to use 'cash on the barrel' and 'cash on the barrelhead', with the same meaning as 'cash on the nail'. Those phrases have a much stronger claim to have a literal derivation, as barrels were used as impromptu counters in US stores and yard sales.

Vis-à-visMeaningIn a position facing another. Literally 'face to face'. Often now used in the sense of 'in relation to'.OriginThe term is French and began to be used in English in the mid 18th century. The French spelling is vis-à-vis, i.e. with the grave accent, although that is often omitted when written in English. It is now frequently printed, no doubt to French shrugs and mutterings, as 'vis-a-vis' or even 'viz-a-viz'.When 'vis-à-vis' was introduced into England it was provided with two distinct meanings, both of which were in use from the 1750s onward. Oddly, it seems that these were both introduced by the author and politician Horace Walpole.The first meaning was the literal translation from the French, i.e. 'face-to-face'. Walpole was an incurable letter writer and, fortunately for us, many of his letters have been published in a collection of books, which provides the first citation we have of the term in English, in Letter to George Montague, July 1753: "He was walking slowly in the beau milieu of Brentford town, without any company, but with a brown lap-dog with long ears, two pointers, two pages, three footmen, and a vis-a-vis following him."What he meant by a 'vis-a-vis' in that letter was 'a small two-seater carriage, in which the passengers sat face-to-face'. These carriages were similar to the four-seater version that Queen Elizabeth uses each year to tour the course at the Royal Ascot race meeting. The meaning was extended to apply to any person or thing that was facing another, for example, one's dance partner, someone sitting across the table at mealtime, couples meeting in the street, etc. Mary Berry included a citation of the first of these in Social life in England and France from 1780 to 1830, 1831:It seems perfectly indifferent to them [the peasant men and women dancing] who is their vis-à-vis. Secondly, it meant 'with regard to'/'in relation to'. Horace Walpole again, in Letter to R. Bentley, November 1755:"What a figure would they make vis-à-vis his manly vivacity and dashing eloquence."It is this second meaning that we have held on to. We can now safety substitute 'with regard to' for 'vis-a-vis' with little fear of misinterpretation.

Carpe diemMeaningIf Google's search records are anything to go by, more people visit my website (http://www.phrases.org.uk/) looking for the little-used phrase 'carpe diem' than they do for any other phrase, so let's have a look at it...'Carpe diem' is usually translated from the Latin as 'seize the day'. However, the more pedantic of Latin scholars may very well seize you by the throat if you suggest that translation. 'Carpe' translates literally as 'pluck', with particular reference to the picking of fruit, so a more accurate rendition is 'enjoy the day, pluck the day when it is ripe'. The extended version of the phrase 'carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero' translates as 'Pluck the day, trusting as little as possible in the future'. The meaning is similar to that of many proverbs that we continue to use in English and is a warning to make the most of the time we have, with the implication that our time on Earth is short. Other such proverbs are 'Strike while the iron is hot', 'The early bird catches the worm', 'Gather ye rosebuds while ye may', and so on. OriginThe original source for the Latin phrase is the lyric poet Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65 BC – 8 BC), more widely known as Horace. The term is first found in Odes Book I:Dum loquimur, fugerit invidaAetas: carpe diem, quam minimum credula posterowhich translates as:While we're talking, envious time is fleeing: pluck the day, put no trust in the futureMany authors have quoted the Latin original, but it was Lord Byron's use of the phrase that first began to integrate it into English. He included it in his 1817 work 'Letters', which was published in 1830 by Thomas Moore:"I never anticipate, - carpe diem - the past at least is one's own, which is one reason for making sure of the present."The noble George Gordon Noel, sixth Baron Byron, is better known as a womaniser than as a Latin scholar, but he was well versed in the language and was a Horace aficionado. He was taught Latin as a child by the son of his bootmaker and went on to write his version of Horace's Ars Poetica (The Art of Poetry), as 'Hints from Horace', in 1811.See also - Latin Phrases in English.

A little knowledge is a dangerous thingMeaningA small amount of knowledge can mislead people into thinking that they are more expert than they really are.Origin'A little knowledge is a dangerous thing' and 'a little learning is a dangerous thing' have been used synonymously since the 18th century. The 'a little learning' version is widely attributed to Alexander Pope (1688 - 1744). It is found in An Essay on Criticism, 1709, and I can find no earlier example of the expression in print:A little learning is a dangerous thing; drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring: there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, and drinking largely sobers us again.The similarity of the two phrases is demonstrated by what appears to be an impromptu coining of 'a little knowledge is a dangerous thing' in a piece in The monthly miscellany; or Gentleman and Lady's Complete Magazine, Vol II, 1774, in which the writer misquoted Pope:Mr. Pope says, very truly, "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."Both Pope's original verse and the misquotation of it were predated by an anonymous author, signing himself 'A B', in the collection of letters published in 1698 as The mystery of phanaticism:"Twas well observed by my Lord Bacon, That a little knowledge is apt to puff up, and make men giddy, but a greater share of it will set them right, and bring them to low and humble thoughts of themselves.Again, there is a degree of misquotation here, as what 'my Lord Bacon', the English politician and philosopher Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban, actually said, in The Essays: Of Atheism, 1601, was:"A little philosophy inclineth man’s mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men’s minds about to religion." So, who coined the phrase? It appears to have been a group effort. Bacon can be credited with the idea, Pope with the 'learning' version and the mysterious 'A B' with the 'knowledge' version.

Mind your Ps and QsMeaningBe on your best behaviour; be careful of your language. Ps and Qs are just the plurals of the letters P and Q. There is some disagreement amongst grammarians about how to spell Ps and Qs - either upper-case or lower-case and either with or without an apostrophe. You may see the phrase as 'mind your p's and q's' or 'mind your Ps and Qs' or 'mind your P's and Q's' or (less often) as 'mind your ps and qs'. I've opted for Ps and Qs.Doubts also exist as to the original meaning. Francis Grose, in his 1785 edition of The Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, defines it like this:"To mind one's P's and Q's; to be attentive to the main chance."OriginThe date of the coinage of 'mind your Ps and Qs' is uncertain. There is a citation from Thomas Dekker's play, The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet, 1602, which appears to be the earliest use of the expression:Afinius: ...here's your cloak; I think it rains too.Horace: Hide my shoulders in't.Afinius: 'Troth, so thou'dst need; for now thou art in thy Pee and Kue: thou hast such a villanous broad back...'Pee and Kue' in that citation seem to be referring to a form of clothing, but that is somewhat ambiguous. It is also not clear that the 'Pee and Kue' in Dekker's work are the same as those in 'mind one's Ps and Qs'. Dekker later used the term in West-ward Hoe, a joint work with John Webster, 1607:At her p. and q. neither Marchantes Daughter, Aldermans Wife, young countrey Gentlewoman, nor Courtiers Mistris, can match her. In that piece it is less apparent that 'p. and q.' refer to a form of clothing. So, both the spelling and meaning of the phrase are debatable. Now we come to what is really uncertain - the derivation. Nevertheless, it is one of those phrases that many people are sure they know the origin of. When such folk are pressed, what they usually mean is that the person they first heard explain the origin had made a random choice from the list of proposed derivations below. As no one knows the origin I'll just list the suggestions - 'mind your Ps and Qs' probably derives from one of these: 1. Mind your pints and quarts. This is suggested as deriving from the practice of chalking up a tally of drinks in English pubs (on the slate). Publicans had to make sure to mark up the quart drinks as distinct from the pint drinks. This explanation is widely repeated but there's little to support it, apart from the fact that pint and quart begin with P and Q. 2. Advice to printers' apprentices to avoid confusing the backward-facing metal type lowercase Ps and Qs, or the same advice to children who were learning to write. I've never heard any suggestion that anyone should 'mind their Ds and Bs' though, even though that makes just as much sense and has the added benefit of rhyming, which would have made it a more attractive slogan. 3. Mind your pea (jacket) and queue (wig). Pea jackets were short rough woollen overcoats, commonly worn by sailors in the 18th century. Perruques were full wigs worn by fashionable gentlemen. It is difficult to imagine the need for an expression to warn people to avoid confusing them. 'Pee', as a name for a man's coarse coat, is recorded as early as 1485, so it is possible that that is what Dekker was referring to in his 1602 citation. If so, that usage long predates all others and we have the definitive origin of 'pee and kue'. 'Kue' or 'cue' as the name of a man's wig isn't known until well after 1602 though, so it still isn't certain what Dekker meant by it. 4. Mind your pieds (feet) and queues (wigs). This is suggested to have been an instruction given by French dancing masters to their charges. This has the benefit of placing the perruque in the right context - as long as we accept the phrase as being originally French. However, there's no reason to suppose it is from France and no version of the phrase exists in French. 5. Another version of the 'advice to children' origin has it that 'Ps and Qs' derives from 'mind your pleases and thank-yous''. That is widely touted as an origin but seems to me to be a back-formation, i.e. an explanation fitted to explain the phrase after it was coined in some other context. 'Pleases and thank-yous' doesn't appear to lead to 'Ps and Qs'. So, pay nothing and take your choice. For what it's worth, my virtual two-pennyworth goes to 2b, i.e. the advice to children who were learning to write.

Vice versaMeaningThe reverse of the previous statement, with the main items transposed. Vice versa originates as Latin, with the literal translation being 'the other way round' or 'the position being reversed', but is now fully absorbed into English. The phrase is usually used to imply the complement of a statement without expressing as much in words. For example:"Fish can't live where we are most comfortable, and vice versa". It is often misspelt as visa versa.OriginThe English language has many expressions that refer to things being the wrong way around - 'inside out', 'upside down', 'topsy-turvy', 'the cart before the horse', 'arsy versy' etc. Even the commonplace word 'preposterous' literally means 'back-to-front'. This extravagance may be accounted for by an age-old English preoccupation with the supernatural and things that are not as they should be - the struggle between good and evil in other words. 'Arsy versy' is the oldest of these expressions, but this has now gone out of regular use and has been replaced by its modern compatriot 'arse about face'. It is first found in Richard Taverner's Prouerbes or adagies with newe addicions, gathered out of the Chiliades of Erasmus, 1539:"Ye set the cart before the horse - cleane contrarily and arsy versy as they say."'Vice versa' is also found in print quite early, as in Anthony Copley's An answere to a letter of a Jesuited gentleman by his cousin, 1601:"They are like to bee put to such a penance and the Arch-Priests vice-versa to be suspended and attained as Schismaticall."In 1915, the psychologist Edgar Rubin created a 'face/vase' cognitive illusion that is a visual equivalent of the phrase. Sadly, being Danish, Rubin described the conundrum as a 'synsoplevede figurer' (visual figure) and missed the linguistic open goal of calling the illusion 'Vase versa'

Houston, we have a problemMeaningOriginally a genuine report of a life-threatening fault. Now used humorously to report any kind of problem.Origin'Houston, we have a problem' is right up there with 'Beam me up Scotty' at the top of the spaceflight-related quotations tree. In fact, both are slight misquotations.John Swigert, Jr. and James Lovell who, with Fred Haise Jr., made up the crew of the US's Apollo 13 moon flight, reported a problem back to their base in Houston on 14th April, 1970. 'Houston, we have a problem' is often credited to the project's leader Lovell. Actually, not only did Lovell not say the phrase, he wasn't even the first not to say it, if you see what I mean. Swigert and then Lovell (almost) used the phrase to report a major technical fault in the electrical system of one of the Service Module's oxygen tanks:Swigert: 'Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here.' Duke: 'This is Houston. Say again please.' Lovell: 'Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a main B bus undervolt.' 'Houston, we have a problem' was used later as the tagline for the 1995 film - Apollo 13. It is the dialogue of the film. edited for dramatic effect, that is now best remembered:Uh, this is Houston. Uh, say again, please? Houston, we have a problem. We have a main bus B undervolt.The issue of the film brought about a renewal in the use of the line and, from then onwards, it began being used in non-spaceflight contexts. The first example of such that I can find is as the title of a none too favourable review in the Los Angles Times, July 1995, of a restaurant called Houstons:Houston('s), we have a problem - Houston's is yet another slick corporate package, the antithesis of a mom-and-pop restaurant.  The phrase was used again, in 2001, to report the health and addiction problems of the singer Whitney Houston. More recently still, it has been called out of retirement, as "Wii have a problem", for use in stories about injuries caused by over-enthusiastic use of the Nintendo game console.

Montezuma's revengeMeaningThe diarrhoea (spelled in America as diarrhea) that is often suffered by tourists when travelling to foreign parts.OriginMontezuma II (also spelled Moctezuma II) was Emperor of Mexico from 1502 to 1520 and was in power when the Spanish began their conquest of the Aztec Empire. The sickness, colloquially known as the 'squits/runs/trots' and more formally as 'Traveller's Diarrhoea', is usually caused by drinking the local water or eating spicy food that visitors aren't accustomed to. It is a bacteriological illness, always uncomfortable, and occasionally serious. Most cases are caused by the E. coli bacterium.The revenge element of the phrase alludes to the supposed hostile attitude of countries that were previously colonized by stronger countries, which are now, in this small but effective way, getting their own back.There are many countries that were previously colonised that are now tourist destinations, and names for the condition reflect the part of the world concerned. These euphemisms are usually comic, reflecting the embarrassment felt by the sufferer and the amusement of the lucky non-sufferers. Of course, although Montezuma clearly had no reason to love the Conquistadors, his revenge isn't reserved for Spaniards - other names for it are:The Gringo Gallop The Aztec Two-stepThose unlucky enough to suffer from the condition in Asia might hear it called:Gandhi's Revenge, Delhi Belly, The Rangoon Runs, Bombay Belly (India)Gyppy Tummy, The Cairo Two-step, Pharaoh's Revenge, Mummy's Tummy (Egypt)Bali Belly (Indonesia)Travellers from Asia to the west are just as likely to suffer the illness, as it isn't caused primarily by insanitary conditions but by ingesting a strain of the E. Coli bacterium that one's body is unaccustomed to - an event just as likely in London and Los Angeles as it is in Cairo and Kuala Lumpur.Delhi Belly and Gyppy Tummy were the first of these terms to gain wide usage and they appeared during WWII, when many British and US servicemen were fighting in North Africa and Asia. The earliest citations in print are from the Indiana Evening Gazette, October 1942:Americans on duty overseas are learning also to guard against "Teheran tummy" and "Delhi belly"and in Alan Moorehead's A Year of Battle, 1943, which pretty much sums things up:"Few set foot in Egypt without contracting 'Gyppy Tummy'... It recurs at irregular intervals and it makes you feel terrible."As a phrase, Montezuma's revenge isn't particularly old. The earliest citation of it in print that I can find is from the US newspaper The Modesto Bee, February 1959:In Mexico it sometimes is called the Aztec curse, Montezuma's revenge... and other colorful names. It can be either a mild or explosive illness.

Good riddanceMeaningAn expression of pleasure on being rid of some annoyance - usually an individual.Origin'Riddance' is now so completely associated with this little phrase that it is rarely, if ever, seen out alone. The only sort of riddance on offer these days is a good one. It wasn't always thus. In the 16th century a riddance was a general-purpose noun and meant 'deliverance from' or 'getting rid of'. The first adjectives to be linked with the word were fayre/happy/gladsome and, in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, 1600, Portia wishes the Prince of Morocco 'a gentle riddance'.A very early use of riddance comes in John Rastell's poem, Away Mourning, circa 1525:I haue her lost, For all my cost, Yet for all that I trowe I haue perchaunce, A fayre ryddaunce, And am quyt of a shrew.Shakespeare appears to be the coiner of 'good riddance', in Troilus and Cressida, 1606:Thersites: I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come any more to your tents: I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.[Exits]Patroclus: A good riddance.The phrase is often extended and emphasized as 'good riddance to bad rubbish' or, as that extended form was first coined, 'good riddance of bad rubbish'. Tobias Smollett used the phrase in a none too friendly comment, inThe Critical Review, 1805:But we are sorry ... to consider Mr. Pratt's writings as 'purely evil' ... we should really look upon this author's departure from the world of literature as a good riddance of bad rubbish.The American journalist and member of President Andrew Jackson's 'Kitchen Cabinet', Francis Preston Blair, wrote an editorial in The Extra Globe, 1841. In this he appears to have been the first to use the precise version of the phrase that is most commonly used now:[Following the withdrawal of members of a rival advisory group] From the bottom of our hearts we are disposed to exclaim "Good riddance to bad rubbish."

Knock into a cocked hatMeaningTo beat severely.OriginOf course, 'knocked into a cocked hat' only makes any sense if you know what cocked hats are. These were hats, popular at the end of the 18th century, that had turned up (i.e. cocked) brims. They were usually tricorn (i.e. three-cornered) hats and were often worn as part of some form of official regalia. They were first mentioned in print in William Wycherley's play The Gentleman Dancing-master, 1673:Instead of laced coats, belts, and pantaloons,Your velvet jumps, gold chains, and grave fur gownsInstead of periwigs, and broad cocked hats,Your satin caps, small cuffs, and vast cravats.The 'Toby jugs' that are still commonplace household ornaments in the UK were usually modelled wearing cocked hats. Toby was Toby Phillpot, not a real person but a stylized version of the brown earthenware 'fill pot' jugs that were used in English pubs to refill tankards before beer pumps were invented. The figures are usually shown holding a fill pot.Some etymologists have speculated that 'knocked into a cocked hat' derived from the game of Ninepins. The theory was that when the pins were struck so that just three were left, in a triangular cocked hat shape, they were too badly out of shape for the game to be won on one throw. Theory appears to be the right word for this explanation, as there is no supporting evidence to back it up. A more likely derivation is that 'to knock someone into a cocked hat' was simply to pummel them so badly as to alter their normal appearance.Cocked hats were also worn in America in the 19th century and 'knocked into a cocked hat', despite the hat's link with Olde Englande's town criers, beadles and taverns, is actually an American phrase. It is first found in the 1830s, as in this example from the New York State newspaper, The Rural Repository, 1837: 'Blood and vengeance!' exclaimed Boniface, 'get out of my house, you varmints, or I will knock you into a cocked hat, and gormandize you!'This was probably more of a concern to Boniface's erstwhile opponents than it is to us, but 'gormandize' means 'eat voraciously'.

Five o'clock shadowMeaningBeard regrowth that darkens a man's features late in the day, following a morning shave.OriginIn the 1980s, designer stubble became fashionable, based largely on the popularity and 'coolness' of stars like George Michael and, before him, Clint Eastwood's 'Man with no name' character. This was quite an achievement as, prior to then, a swarthy and unshaven appearance was considered to be reserved for ruffians and ne'er do wells. Respectable men were expected to be either clean-shaven or to have a full moustache or beard. If a man planned to grow a beard, he usually waited until he was away on a holiday and not seen in public for a few days, until the 'five o'clock shadow', as it was then universally called, phase was passed.Why 'five of the clock'? Why not four or six? The 'five o'clock shadow' coinage was based on the 19th century upper-crust English habit of taking tea at five o'clock. Not that the notably upper-crust 7th Earl of Shaftesbury had much time for it. He is reported in Edwin Hodder's biography, 1886, as saying:Five o'clock tea, that pernicious, unprincipled and stomach-ruining habit.Nevertheless, the teas became popular with the middle-classes and became known as 'five o'clocks' and, when the habit travelled the Atlantic to the USA, light late-afternoon meals were renamed 'five o'clock dinners'.Step forward to the 1930s and into the marketing department of theGem Safety Razor Company. While dreaming up a new advertising campaign, they decided to try and convince previously unsuspecting men that they suffered from 'ugly, afternoon beard growth' and that this could only be countered by the purchase and use of 'Gem Micromatic Blades'. Needing a snappy name for this late-afternoon ailment, which would of course bar sufferers from any genteel 'five o'clock dinner', they chose to call it 'five o'clock shadow'.

Fell off the back of a truckMeaningA euphemism for 'acquired illegally'.OriginWhen anyone accounts for their possession of an article by saying it 'fell off the back of a truck' or 'fell off the back of a lorry', they may be assumed not to be its legal owner - i.e. it is stolen. 'Lorry' is the British version; in the USA and Australia things fall from trucks. This coy language, which feigns innocence but actually emphasizes illegality by using a phrase that is reserved for illegal dealing, is similar to The Godfather's 'an offer he can't refuse'. Others that relate specifically to stolen goods are the 'five finger discount' and 'I got it from a man in a pub'. Had 'air quotes' been in use at the time they might well have been called on when this phrase was first spoken.The earliest printed versions of 'fell off the back of a lorry' come surprisingly late - like this early example from The Times, 1968:"The suggestion of the finder, a casual motorist, that the records 'must have fallen off the back of a lorry'."There are many anecdotal reports of the phrase in the UK from much earlier than that, and it is likely to date back to at least WWII. It's just the sort of language that the 'wide-boys' or 'flash Harrys' who peddled illegal goods during and after WWII would have used. These were exemplified in plays and films by the actors George Cole, Sid James, etc. I'm sure a thorough scan of the scripts of the post-war Ealing comedies would throw up a pre-1968 example.Having been brought up in the truck-free UK with the 'fell off the back of a lorry' version, I have to now concede supremacy to 'fell off the back of a truck'. Versions of that from both Australia and the USA predate the English examples by many years. The earliest that I can find is from the official record of debates in the Australian House of Representatives - Hansard, 1928:"We heard, through something that had fallen of the back of a truck onto a reporter's table."In the USA the expression is found just a few years later - as in this example from The Tuscaloosa News, February 1937:Many transients in Manhattan are constantly being trimmed by suave 'chauffers' in light delivery trucks who whisper confidentially that there are some bolts of cloth in the rear seat which fell of the back of a truck.The meaning seems to have changed slightly since the phrase was coined. Almost all of the early references cite it as being used as patter in a scam to sell the unwary shoddy goods. The current usage is as a reference to a straightforward 'nudge, nudge/I won't tell if you won't' sale of stolen or smuggled goods.A nostalgic word about lorries. Trucks are now travelling the world and, in the same way that the voracious American Grey Squirrel has overwhelmed the retiring European Red Squirrel, they are, on the road and in the dictionary, becoming dominant. The older generation in the UK is holding out and will have no truck with 'truck' but, as time goes by, lorries will turn into trucks, just a charabancs turned into coaches.

Have no truck withMeaningTo reject or to have nothing to do with.OriginWe are all familiar with trucks as carts and road vehicles, but that's not what's being referred to in 'have no truck with'. This 'truck' is the early French word 'troque', which meant 'an exchange; a barter' and came into Middle English as 'truke'. The first known record of truke is the Vintner's Company Charter in the Anglo-Norman text of the Patent Roll of Edward III, 1364. This relates to a transaction for some wine which was to be done 'by truke, or by exchange'.So, to 'have truck with' was to barter or do business' with. In the 17th century and onward, the meaning of 'truck' was extended to include 'association'/'communication' and 'to have truck with' then came to mean 'commune with'.'Truck' is now usually only heard in the negative and this usage began in the 19th century. To 'have no truck with' came to be a general term for 'have nothing to do with'. An example of that is cited in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1834:Theoretically an officer should have no truck with thieves.'Trucking' was also country slang for 'courting'/'dallying with' (and no, in case you are wondering, it has nothing to do with any similar word beginning with 'f'). To 'have no more truck' meant that a courtship had ceased. An example of that usage in print is found in Notes and Queries, 1866:[In Suffolk] A man who has left off courting a girl, says that he has 'no more truck along o'har'.'No truck with' may seem rather antiquated language now, although it is still used. Even older is a version that hasn't often been heard since Grandma's day - 'brook no truck with'. 'Brook' in this context means 'make use of/enjoy' and adds emphasis to the standard 'have no truck'. The image I have of someone who would 'brook no truck' is Queen Victoria, in her later and more 'unamused' years. A truculent woman at that stage by many accounts, although 'truculent' and 'truck' aren't related.Going back to the original 'barter' meaning of truck, this also became extended to include the sundry items that were bartered and also small odd jobs or errands. The stores that were set up to service the needs of itinerant navvies while they were building the UK's canals and railways were known as 'truck stores' or 'tommy shops'. The great rural campaigner William Cobbett referred to these in his classic, Rural Rides, 1825:In the iron country [the Black Country]... the truck or tommy system generally prevails.The navvies' sites were often far from towns and were the only places that the workmen could shop. The shops were generally ruinously expensive and provided poor quality goods. The workers were often paid in vouchers that could only be 'trucked' at the workplace shop. In the USA such shops were known as company stores and are the subject of the well-known American song Sixteen Tons:You load sixteen tons, what do you get?Another day older and deeper in debt.Saint Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go;I owe my soul to the company store.Note: 'Truck shops' and 'truck stops' are only distantly related. The American term 'truck stop' arose independently as the name of the places that truck drivers and their trucks get refreshment.The alternative name of 'tommy shop' derives from the widely used term 'tommy' which appears in several terms that were coined around the late 19th century:Tommy Atkins - the generic name of a British soldier of the line.Tommy rot - referring to the basic rations available in tommy/truck shops.Brown tommy - rough brown bread available in tommy/truck shops.Tommy bar - a small spade.I can find no definition of 'tommy' from the time that these terms were coined, but the meaning of any of them wouldn't be altered much by exchanging it for 'humble'/'unexceptional'.Truck shops may be a thing of the past in the developed world but, with the advent of e-commerce, trucks now bring the shopping to us.

My cup of teaMeaningSomething or someone that one finds pleasing.OriginAn English website about the English language can't of course be complete without some consideration of tea. Tea has been around for a long time, and so has the British slang term for it - 'char'. In fact, it was known in the west by that version of the Mandarin ch'a before the name migrated through several languages to 'chay', 'tay' and was finally Anglicised as 'tea'. The Dutch adventurer Jan Huygen van Linschoten was one of the first to recount its use as a drink, in Discours of voyages into ye Easte & West Indies, 1598:The aforesaid warme water is made with the powder of a certaine hearbe called Chaa.'My cup of tea' is just one of the many tea-related phrases that are still in common use in the UK, such as 'Not for all the tea in China', 'I could murder a cup of tea', 'More tea vicar?', 'Tea and sympathy', 'Rosie Lee', 'Storm in a teacup' and so on.In the early 20th century, a 'cup of tea' was such a synonym for acceptability that it became the name given to a favoured friend, especially one with a boisterous, life-enhancing nature. William de Morgan, the Edwardian artist and novelist, used the phrase in the novel Somehow Good, 1908, and went on to explain its meaning:"He may be a bit hot-tempered and impulsive... otherwise, it's simply impossible to help liking him." To which Sally replied, borrowing an expression from Ann the housemaid, that Fenwick was a cup of tea. It was metaphorical and descriptive of invigoration.People or things with which one felt an affinity began to be called 'my cup of tea' in the 1930s. Nancy Mitford appears to be the first to record that term in print, in the comic novel Christmas Pudding, 1932:I'm not at all sure I wouldn't rather marry Aunt Loudie. She's even more my cup of tea in many ways.In keeping with the high regard for tea, most of the early references to 'a cup of tea' as a description of an acquaintance are positive ones, i.e. 'nice', 'good', 'strong' etc. The expression is more often used in the 'not my cup of tea' form these days. This negative usage began in WWII. An early example of it is found in Hal Boyle's Leaves From a War Correspondent's Notebook column, which described English life and manners for an American audience. The column provided the American counterpart to Alister Cooke's Letter from America and was syndicated in various US papers. In 1944, he wrote:[In England] You don't say someone gives you a pain in the neck. You just remark "He's not my cup of tea."The change from the earlier positive 'my cup of tea' phrase, to the dismissive 'not my cup of tea' doesn't reflect the national taste for the drink itself. Tea remains our cup of tea here in the UK. According to the United Kingdom Tea Council (of course, there had to be one) 60 million of us down 160 million cups of the stuff each day.

Doff your hatMeaningRaise your hat in acknowledgement of or deference to another.OriginDoffing seems to be an activity that is limited to hats or caps; it isn't often that we hear the verb used in any other connection. That needn't be the case though, as becomes apparent when one realises the connection between 'doffing' and 'donning'. We can don hats and caps, but we can also also don clothes, shoes, even a persona or a set of ideas and, as doffing is the opposite of donning, anything that can be donned can later be doffed. The origins of these strange little words are simply 'do on' and 'do off'.When the terms 'doff' and 'don' were first used there was no especial connection with headgear. The first usage of it that I can find in print is from Sir Thomas Malory's Le morte Darthur, circa 1470:Doffe of thy clothes, And knele in thy kyrtylle. [A tunic or petticoat]Shakespeare was fond of the word 'doff' and used it frequently, often in a figurative manner, which alludes both to the removal of clothes and of opinions. In King John, 1595, he has Constance say "Thou weare a Lyons hide! doff it for shame." and in The Taming of the Shrew, 1596 "Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate". He also frequently used the alternative 'daff' and its past tense 'daft', as in the 1597 sonnet A Lover's Complaint: "There my white stole of chastity I daft."The falling out of daily use of 'doff' isn't just because men no longer routinely wear hats - the usage appears to be geographically biased. Here in the North of England, caps are still doffed, whereas in Scotland the term was considered archaic even by the 18th century. Samuel Johnson defined 'doff' in A dictionary of the English language, 1755, as "to put off dress; to strip" but later dismissed it as "in all its senses obsolete, and scarcely used except by rustics". In America, gentlemen have always preferred to 'tip' their hats, that is, signal a salutation by a slight tug at the hat's rim, rather than to doff them, which involves a brief removal.In the 16th to the 18th centuries in England, the donning and doffing of hats was governed by a code of etiquette and custom that it is hard for us now to appreciate. Every man of standing wore a hat, and the form of hat and the rules governing when it could be removed or for whom it should be raised in acknowledgement were bewilderingly complex. Hat doffing was an accompaniment to bowing and the depth of the bow determined how far the hat was lifted. In 1896, James Boyle, in an attempt to remove the drudgery of continually lifting his hat, registered a patent for a form of self-doffing device. When the wearer bowed to an acquaintance, the hat lifted itself, rotated once and lowered again. The hats didn't catch on. As Shakespeare might have put it - it was a daft idea.

Let there be lightOriginThis week's phrase is prompted by the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the publication of the King James Version of the Bible (or Authorised Version). The KJV is a strong contender for the accolade of 'the book that has had more influence on the development of English than any other'.Many phrases that are now common currency in the language appeared first in the King James Bible. Likewise, a varied collection of everyday words also first saw the printer's ink in the work; for example, 'accurately', 'battering-ram', 'expansion', 'gopher', 'ingenuously', 'needleworker', 'phrasing', and so on...The text of the KJV has been used in numerous important works; from the libretto of the best known of all choral oratorios, Handel's Messiah, 1741, which is taken almost verbatim from the Authorised Version, to Martin Luther King'sI have a dream speech, which he delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington in 1963 and in which he quoted directly from the KJV, Isaiah 40:4:"[I have a dream that one day] every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together."However, the influential power of the book isn't based on the number of phrases and words that were coined for it; earlier versions of the Bible and luminaries like Shakespeare can claim many more. Its impact came because it brought clearly expressed, accessible and poetically beautiful English to the populace for the first time. The KJV was written to be spoken and, as James I's authorisation states, it was 'appointed to be read in Churches'. Church services in England at that date consisted largely of readings from the Bible. By providing short verses in the plain colloquial English that the illiterate congregation could understand and remember, the verses became cemented into the spoken language. No verse exemplifies this power and simplicity better than one from the very beginning of the book "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light". This is one of the best-known phrases in English. It is a translation of the Latin 'dixitque Deus fiat lux et facta est lux' (which hardly trips off the tongue) and appears in the opening lines of the Bible, in Genesis I. The English translation was first printed in Miles Coverdale's Bible, 1535, but the version of it that was known by every English speaker from the 17th century onward was that of the King James Version, 1611:In the beginning God created the Heauen, and the Earth.And the earth was without forme, and voyd, and darkenesse was vpon the face of the deepe: and the Spirit of God mooued vpon the face of the waters.And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.The tendency of US politicians towards over-wordiness was compared unfavourably to the beauty and clarity of the original text by the journalist and broadcaster Alistair Cooke. In his acceptance speech for the 'Best Speaker of English' award in 1998, he gave an imagined US Government representative's version of Genesis 1:3:"The Supreme Being mandated the illumination of the Universe and this directive was enforced forthwith."

Spruce-upMeaningTo make smart and trim.OriginSpruce-up is just a little phrase, but it has taken quite a journey to get to us in its present state. The state it started from was Prussia. The 14th century word spruce is a variant of Pruce, which was itself a shortened version of Prussia. Originally, things that were spruce were those items brought from Prussia. For example, spruce fir trees and, more to the point for this phrase, spruce leather.From the end of the 16th century, spruce was used as a verb meaning 'to make trim and neat'. In The terrors of the night, or, a discourse of apparitions, 1594, Thomas Nashe equates 'sprucing' with 'cleaning':[You shall] spend a whole twelue month in spunging & sprucing.A jerkin made from the expensive imported spruce leather was the fashion accessory of choice for Tudor and Stuart noblemen. Robert Greene, in A Quip for an Upstart Courtier - a quaint dispute between Cloth-breeches and Velvet-breeches, 1592, paints a picture of the dandy of the day:"A fellow briskly apparelled, in a blacke taffata doublet, and a spruce leather jerkin with christall buttons."'Spruce' moved from being an adjective, describing leather and other goods from Prussia, to a verb, meaning 'make smart and neat'.The first mention of 'sprucing-up' comes in Sir George Etherege's Restoration drama The Man of Mode, 1676:"I took particular notice of one that is alwaies spruc'd up with a deal of dirty Sky-colur'd Ribband."In 20th century America, the term 'spruce-up' took on a new lease of life, with a slightly modified meaning. It began to be used there to mean 'tidy-up; refurbish' - a counterpart to the English 'Spring-clean'. Up until then 'sprucing-up' had been reserved for people and their clothes.Many of the early references to sprucing up refer to adding ribbons to clothing but it seems that, to really spruce yourself up, you need a (preferably German) leather jacket.

As cute as a bug's earMeaningVery cute.OriginImagine for a moment a bug's ear... Cute picture? Hardly. You are more likely to be imagining something that might be at home in The Day of the Triffids. Do bugs (that's insects if you are reading in the UK) even have ears? Again, hardly. Many of them can detect sound, but they use a variety of strange means of doing it and none of them come equipped with anything resembling a human ear.Similes of the type 'as white as snow', 'as busy as a bee' almost always refer to a property that is archetypally appropriate for the item in question. So why would anyone have imagined a bug's ear to be especially cute?The phrase originated in the southern states of America in the latter part of the 19th century and is still more common there than elsewhere. I've never heard it in conversation here in Yorkshire for instance. No-one, even in Texas, where the phrase is often said to have originated, thought that bugs' ears were cute. What they did think, and they had a point here as insects can detect very miniscule and high-pitched sounds, is that they were 'acute'.'Cute' was a synonym for 'acute' in the 1700s in England. Nathan Bailey defined it in The Universal Etymological English Dictionary, 1731, as:Cute: sharp, quick-witted, shrewd.The term crossed the Atlantic and in 1848 the US romantic poet James Russell Lowell used the term with the 'sharp; shrewd' meaning in The Biglow Papers:Aint it cute to see a Yankee Take sech everlastin' pains?An early example of 'cute as a bug's ear' is found in a story in the South Carolina newspaper the Charleston Sunday News, June 1891:Imogene McGinty is as cute as a bug's ear.From around that time onwards, in the USA, the 'pretty; charming' meaning of cute began to supersede the previous 'acute' meaning, although the earlier meaning persisted for much longer in the UK, where it is still used.Other 'as cute as' phrases came later and all of them rely on the present-day 'pretty; adorable' meaning. Examples are, 'as cute as a kitten/button/cupcake'. The expression 'as cute as a bug in a rug' is also quite commonplace. Bugs in rugs can't be said to be either especially sharp-witted or cuddly and that odd simile is just a merging of 'as cute as a bug's ear' and 'as snug as a bug in a rug'.So, if you want 'cute', try a baby panda - bug's ears are 'acute'.

It's not rocket scienceMeaningIt (the subject under discussion) isn't difficult to understand.OriginIt is probably no surprise to hear that this phrase is American in origin. Of the English-speaking countries, America was the first to adopt a sustained programme for the development of rocket science. The first people who were widely known as rocket scientists were a group of German military technologists, who were transported to the USA in 1945 following their capture by allied troops in WWII. Other similar groups were transported to the UK and the USSR.Led by Werner Von Braun, the US group had previous expertise in the field, having developed the V-2 rocket that had been used to attack London and other targets earlier in the war. Their success during the 1940s and 50s in developing the sophisticated technology required for military and space rockets, was the reason for rocket science being equated in the US public's mind with outstanding expertise. The perceived equation of 'rocket scientist = German = clever' can only have been enhanced by the persona of another German scientist of acknowledged genius, who was also working in the USA at the time - Albert Einstein.The pre-eminence of German scientists in the space race was highlighted by a quotation from 1957, following the Soviet launch of Sputnik-1, the first orbiting satellite. The supposed reply to President Eisenhower's question "How did the Russians get there first?" was "Their Germans are better than our Germans". Many people have been attributed with the coining of that quip, which is a sure sign that no-one is now sure who said it first. It seems rather unlikely that the presidential conversation actually happened, but the line did reflect the national sentiment in the USA at the time and that feeling was the spur for even more German scientific manpower to be deployed, leading to the successful moon exploration programme, in which Von Braun was a central player.If, by 1950, rocket science was generally accepted as being intellectually difficult and outside the capabilities of the average Joe, where and when did relatively undemanding tasks start being said to be 'not rocket science'? The answer to that is - the American Football field in the 1980s. Most of the early citations of 'not rocket science' relate to football; for example, this piece from a sports report in the Pennsylvania newspaper The Daily Intelligencer, December 1985:"Coaching football is not rocket science and it's not brain surgery. It's a game, nothing more."Prior to the 1980s, 'brain surgery' had been the occupation that simple tasks were said not to be. 'It's not brain surgery' dates from the 1960s. Before that, straightforward tasks were simply said to be 'as easy as pie' or 'as easy as falling off a log'.

Let bygones be bygonesMeaningAllow the unpleasant things that have happened in the past to be forgotten.Origin'Let bygones be bygones' is one of the small group of phrases the meaning of which people enquire about more than they do the origin. On the face of it, the meaning is obvious and seems to require no explanation - after all, bygones can hardly be anything other than bygones. We don't have sayings like 'let greengrocers be greengrocers', so is there more to it? As it turns out, there is.In the 15th century, a bygone was was simply 'a thing that has gone by', i.e. a thing of the past. Shakespeare used it with that meaning in The Winters Tale, 1611:This satisfaction, The by-gone-day proclaym'd, say this to him.As time progressed, 'bygones' came to refer specifically to past events that had an unpleasant tinge to them; for example, quarrels or debts. The Scottish churchman Samuel Rutherford recorded that usage of the phrase in a letter during his detention in Aberdeen in 1636. In the letter he regrets the follies of his youth and acknowledges his debt to God in showing him the error of his ways:"Pray that byegones betwixt me and my Lord may be byegones."So, there is a little more to the phrase 'let bygones be bygones' than to the more literal 'let sleeping dogs lie' or the old proverb 'let all things past, pass' that was recorded by John Heywood in his 1562 edition of Proverbs. 'Let bygones be bygones' uses both meanings of the word 'bygones' and means, in extended form, 'let the unpleasantness between us become a thing of the past'.

Which is whichMeaning'Which is which?' - often expressed as a question, asking for help in distinguishing two similar things or people.Origin'Which' is an extremely ancient English word, the modern spelling deriving from the Old English 'hwilc', which dates from the 8th century. There was a myriad of other spellings for 'which' - the OED lists no less than 64 of them - for example 'wheche', 'quhilche', 'wych' and so on.Likewise, 'which is which' is one of the oldest English phrases still in daily use. The earliest form of 'which is which' in print is found in the 14th century Northumbrian poem Cursor Mundi, which uses a 'quilk' spelling:Wel sal he cun knau quilk es quilk.The first person to record 'which is which' in modern English was William Shakespeare, who used the expression in several of his plays, including Macbeth, 1605:What is the night? Almost at oddes with morning, which is which.Almost immediately after that line, Shakespeare gave the stage direction 'Enter three Witches'. He didn't however go on to make the play on words 'which witch is which?' - that had to wait until the 20th century. The first example I can find occurred, appropriately, on Halloween 1931, in the Wisconsin newspaper The Appleton Post-Crescent:There's nothing like a Halloween moon to make people wonder which witch is witch.

Say cheeseMeaningA photographer's instruction just before taking a picture, in order to make people smile.Origin'Say cheese!' must have been said to people posing for photographs as often as 'watch the birdie!'. Articulating a long 'e' sound requires us to draw back our lips and bare our teeth in a grimace, which is the obvious reason for photographers using it. The question is though - why cheese and not some other word? (and, come to that, why birdie? - but more on that later).Despite exhaustive etymological delving, no one has found any literal link between 'say cheese' and meaning of the word cheese. Some have suggested that it relates to the now rather archaic term 'cheese it', meaning 'run away'. That's pure speculation and in any case; why would a photographer just about to take someone's picture encourage them to run away? However, looking up this phrase did uncover a nice punning definition of 'cheese it' in the Indiana Weekly Messenger, October 1910:"What do boys mean when they say 'cheese it?'""It means that something mischievous has a curd and they want to get a whey."Nor is 'say cheese' anything to do with the American expression 'cutting the cheese' about which, if you haven't come across it before, I'll happily leave you in ignorance.We may not know why 'cheese' was chosen over alternatives like 'breeze' or 'please', but I can give a pointer to who first used the word when having a photograph taken. The earliest printed records of the expression are from the 1940s, in particular, this piece from the Texas newspaper The Big Spring Daily Herald, October 1943, titled Need To Put On A Smile? Here's How: Say 'Cheese':Now here's something worth knowing. It's a formula for smiling when you have your picture taken. It comes from former Ambassador Joseph E. Davies and is guaranteed to make you look pleasant no matter what you're thinking. Mr. Davies disclosed the formula while having his own picture taken on the set of his "Mission to Moscow." It's simple. Just say "Cheese," It's an automatic smile. "I learned that from a politician," Mr. Davies chuckled. "An astute politician, a very great politician. But, of course, I cannot tell you who he was..."Ambassador Davies looked every inch the politician who took his own advice. His coy 'I cannot tell you who it was' was no doubt delivered with a wink, as Davies served under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who fits his description perfectly well, as listeners in 1940s America would have been well aware.The fact that the newspaper report presented Davies' recipe as a novelty that its readers would previously be unfamiliar with does suggest that the phrase can't be much earlier than 1943 in origin. It's also reasonable to speculate that Roosevelt was the original source.Photographers these days often prefer to use 'Say, one, two, three', as it produces the same grins and makes sure that all the sitters smile at the same time. While it appears that virtually any 'long e' word could have been chosen instead, 'cheese' has stood the test of time and has resulted in a new adjective - 'cheesy'. People began to speak of 'cheesy grins' or 'cheesy smiles', as demonstrated by Ambassador Davies, in the 1960s. The word 'cheesy', meaning 'vulgar'/'tasteless', derives from the perceived insincerity of cheesy grins.As for 'watch the birdie', this now outdated instruction, usually given to children to get them to face in the right direction for a photographic portrait, unlike 'say cheese', did refer to an actual object. The 'birdies' were animated props that could be made to squawk or warble and so attract a child's attention.
