Christopher D. R. • Shaun, your article portrays my experiences in China spot-on. I have been to 5 major cities in China and have had many conversations with people from the lower-middle class, to highly successful entrepreneurs, to mid-level government officials. Not once did I get a sense that any Chinese person I've experienced has a sense of hostility towards the government. While in Chongqing, I sat in a courtroom during a hearing where a group of employees sued their employer who withheld their last month's paychecks as the company went under, and the employees won. Before I had been to China, I wouldn't have imagined such a peaceful hearing inside of a legitimate court without anybody being paid off (friend's mother was one of 3 judges, so I know she wasn't getting any kickbacks from the employees). Based upon my discussions with many Chinese in their 40's and 50's, and even a few in their 80's, all seem to be very content with the way their lives have improved over the last couple decades. Sitting in a brand new 3,000+ square foot condo overlooking the bay in Zhuhai, I asked a friend's grandfather if 40 years ago he could have ever imagined even visiting such a beautiful home, and he replied "I would have thought it was heaven." As you acknowledged already, there is much left to be done in terms of weeding out corruption (handling of the crumbled schools in the '08 earthquake sticks in my mind) and human rights. However, I would strongly agree that as long as life continues to improve for the large majority in relative terms, China will hold off political unrest for a long time (even though the population may be poor in absolute terms). http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Is-China-Next-Collapse-CNBC-43593.S.47106858?view=&srchtype=discussedNews&gid=43593&item=47106858&type=member&amp;;trk=eml-anet_dig-b_pd-ttl-cnRanjith Ravindiran, P.E. • Hello Mr. Shaun: You have provided excellent reasons for why China will not be next. As you correctly pointed out in your article, China has lot more going for it than against it. If anything, the internal contradictions working against a national goal are greater in India than in China. India should have had its own version of the “Cultural Revolution” China had. But, it didn’t. So, part of it, socially and politically, is stuck in the past and unable to move forward in the same direction as the new generation of educated youths and visionary entrepreneurs would like to see India go. ------------------------------------------------- What's the common eye for “'Cultural Revolution' China had”after all?
