标题: [atcl ctcl 0002]Graham and all the Greenes
帖子内容: 
From The Times Literary Supplement September 8, 2010Graham and all the GreenesDoes seeing Graham Greene in the context of his family help one understand him?Gabriel Josipovici Once upon a time there were two brothers who, at the turn of the twentieth century, settled in the small town of Berkhamsted, at the end of the commuter line in Hertfordshire. They each had six children and it is because of one of these children that the above sentence must immediately evoke in most readers over a certain age a sense of ungraspable melancholy, of secret childhood pleasures on a common, of bored and blighted lives redeemed or partially redeemed by a secret adherence to an ideology, Catholic or Communist. Few writers have made more and better art out of their guilt and childhood unhappiness than Graham Greene, or conveyed more powerfully, in stories, novels and memoirs, the feel of the place where he grew up. Graham’s father was a conventional public-school headmaster, his younger brother a coffee merchant newly returned from Brazil with his German wife and large brood. They were the wealthy Greenes, who lived in a grand house at the other end of town, The Hall. But it was the others, the “Schoolhouse Greenes” who produced the high achievers: not just Graham but Hugh, already a distinguished journalist, with experience of both pre- and post-war Germany when he became Director-General of the BBC; Raymond, a mountaineer and oarsman (all the Greenes were tall, but Ben was six foot seven and Hugh and Raymond close to six foot six) who took part in the failed Everest expedition of 1933, wrote pioneering papers on the effects of high altitude on the body, and became, after the war, a distinguished endocrinologist; and Elisabeth, who worked for MI6 during the war (and recruited Graham and Malcolm Muggeridge). Of the Hall Greenes only Barbara, born in 1907, three years after Graham and three years before Hugh, could vie with this, and indeed she always thought of herself as secretly one of the Schoolhouse Greenes. It was with her that Graham travelled to Liberia in 1931, on the first of his many voyages along lawless roads, and her account of the trip, first published as Land Benighted, has been felt by many, including Graham himself, to be as good as or better than his Journey Without Maps. She fell in love with a German aristocrat, a Catholic from Silesia, who was involved in the attempt to overthrow Hitler, and, having married him, spent the war in Germany. After the war he rose to become German ambassador to the Holy See, before retiring to his estates, always followed by the dutiful Barbara, although she often chafed at the restrictions to her life. A sort of mirror image of Barbara, in the sense that he should by all accounts have been one of the problematic Hall Greenes, was Graham and Hugh’s eldest brother, Herbert. Unaccountably (at least Jeremy Lewis, who is sparing with his attempts at explanation, preferring to stick to facts, fails to account for it), he was from the first a liar, a sponger and what in the terms of the time and class with which this book deals could be described as a blackguard. Not only was he continually asking his parents and siblings for money to make ends meet, but in the 1930s he offered to spy for the Japanese and then tried to sell non-existent information about Japan to the United States; later he took it into his head, when Hugh was Director-General of the BBC, and one of the most enlightened there has been, to embarrass him whenever he could. Regarding Hugh’s decision to move the Nine O’Clock News to ten o’clock as another assault on Old England, he organized a nationwide protest and, according to Lewis, “promised that unless Hugh’s decision was reversed thousands of protesters would march on Broadcasting House and/or the Houses of Parliament, headed by Herbert and General Sir Frederick Morgan, a veteran of D-Day”. To back this up he produced an execrable poem (he tried in vain to get a volume published), part of which runs: From the shores of far New Zealand, From all men of worthy stock, Sounds the call across the Oceans, “Bring us back the nine o’clock!” Bring us back the Chimes that cheered us In the darkest days we knew. . .” [etc.] “Greene is a thoroughly unreliable type of person”, as a memo from MI5 to the War Office put it at the start of the war, “is addicted to drink, and should not be allowed to hold a position in HM Forces”. In a way the most interesting of the twelve siblings were two of the Hall brothers, Ben and Felix, who were neither Establishment successes like Hugh and Raymond nor pariahs like Herbert, but who were tormented all their lives by a combination of abundant talent and energy and an inability to channel it. Ben, the eldest of the Hall children, was an idealist from his earliest childhood, with an almost physical revulsion at the suffering of others, whether man or beast. A Labour candidate in 1931, he worked for the Quakers in Germany in the late 30s, trying to get Jews out of the country, but his pacifism led, in the war years, to rather too great a proximity to right-wing and anti-Semitic groups, and he was even for a while imprisoned (Herbert had given evidence against him) for pro-Fascist sympathies. His case brings out forcefully (though again Lewis avoids all the larger questions raised by his multifarious narrative) the fact, largely suppressed from English consciousness, that had England been overrun by Germany like the rest of Europe, there would have been just as much civil tension, with accusations of betrayal and collaboration on all sides, as there was in France and Italy – tension which would have bedevilled the history of post-war Britain, as it has that of those two countries, had Germany been defeated. Labour historians such as Ben Pimlott have more recently made people aware of the importance of the work Ben Greene did for the democratization of the Labour Party in the 1930s, but the taint of his flirtations with right-wing groups in the war years never left him, and he died still trying, as he saw it, to clear his name. Equally interesting as an example of how varied were the responses to Fascism and Communism in the English-speaking world was the case of his younger brother Felix, almost exactly his cousin Hugh’s contemporary. Felix combined in himself all the contradictions of the Greenes, their strange mixture of idealism and practicality, but where in the case of Graham this produced a powerful blend of hard work and unpretentious technical skill allied to an almost absurdly romantic vision, which resulted in genuine works of art, and in the case of Hugh in the ability to run an enormous Establishment organization yet allow subversive younger colleagues to puncture the pretensions of the Establishment (notably in his championing of That Was the Week That Was), Felix lurched from impossible dreams such as the spiritual salvation of Mankind to successfully selling antiques, without the two ever coming together. Like Ben, he stood as a Labour candidate in 1931, following this with a trip to the Soviet Union, from which he returned ecstatic. He became a skilful journalist and broadcaster, and a pioneer of “social action broadcasting”, where the public is asked for its views, now a staple of radio but then unknown. By 1939 he was in Germany and as enthusiastic about the Nazis as he had been about the Soviet Union. “For far too long”, Lewis quotes him as saying, Germany “has been inferior with a smarting sense of impotence. Power she needs, and power she will get.” This, he felt, could be achieved peacefully “by a close and reliable understanding with Britain”. By the time the war came he was in California, where he fell in with Gerald Heard and with his distant cousin Christopher Isherwood, Aldous Huxley and the New Age “philosophy” they were peddling. The war, he now thought, was “only a symptom of something infinitely more significant, a real mutation of man’s spirit”, conveniently forgetting the atrocities the Nazis were committing or the desperate mental anguish of people such as his sister Barbara, whose lives had been caught up not by the idea of war but by its stark reality. Comforting himself with the thought that “we are all guilty” and that with enough good will and some determined meditation a new world order would emerge, he married another Krishnamurti disciple, Elena Lindeman, a Mexican of German origin, to whom he remained more or less faithful for the whole of his life – though after the birth of their daughter he seems to have gone off sex, diverting his considerable energy to running a business importing antiques from Britain to the US and then, becoming enamoured of Mao’s China, teaching himself how to film and, with the help of his wife and daughter, making many films about China and writing two quite successful books on that country which went on pushing his idealistic views of Mao and his reforms, much to the disgust of more sober analysts like Simon Leys. Of course, none of this would be of interest except to historians of the period, had all these men and women not been related to Graham. Does seeing him in this context help one understand him? Lewis limits his literary criticism to such remarks as that Stamboul Train “was to become, rightly, one of Graham’s more popular novels”, but whether that means that it was so good as to be worthy of popularity or written with such an instinctive sense of what was required for popularity that it was not surprising it achieved it, is not clear. He has a swipe at other Greene biographers, including Norman Sherry. However, though Lewis has conscientiously worked through the archives, there is little here that is not in Sherry nor in the numerous memoirs Greene himself wrote. Nevertheless, in this new context Greene does come across a little differently: cold and aloof to strangers and acquaintances, like Hugh and Raymond (about whom almost exactly the same words are used), he was kindness itself to fellow writers (while never losing his sharp critical sense), and to members of his family (apart from Herbert). What his nephew James Greene wrote of his own father, Hugh, could equally well apply to him: “Of course he was not a bad man (although there was something of the dictator in him . . . ) but he was always more a boy than a ‘father’”. Certainly neither Hugh nor Graham was “a family man”, in that neither could really deal with wives or children, though everyone commented on the extraordinary mixture of immense authority and “boyish mischief” that both exuded. That perhaps was the secret of their success, and its roots clearly lay far back in those dreary Berkhamsted days when both were pupils in their father’s school and had to learn how to cope with the divided loyalties that entailed. The book also, unwittingly, brings home how small the world of the privileged and the cultured was in those days. Not exactly an old boy network, but still striking in the narrowness of its horizons. This kind of thing: "Back in London Hugh met Ian Fleming, who said there was nothing going in naval Intelligence; but Victor Gordon-Lennox introduced him to an RAF officer over lunch at White’s, and, after dazzling his interviewers with his mastery of foreign languages, he was sent to Cockfosters to learn how to interrogate Luftwaffe pilots who had been shot down over England." And: "Sam Guinness was prepared to pay the difference between sending the boys to St Paul’s – Hugh’s first choice – and Eton, and Raymond had a word with his Everest climbing partner, Tom Brocklebank, who agreed to take them both into his house. " It also brings home how differently Jews view the war from the English. I was (perhaps wrongly) surprised by the lack of awareness among all the characters who flit through these pages of what happened to Jews in the Nazi years. I am not talking about the casual anti-Semitism of someone like Waugh, who (rightly, by all accounts), unable to stand the crassness and vulgarity of Catherine Walston, the great love of Graham’s life and the cause of the break-up of his marriage, wrote to Nancy Mitford: “Mrs W is good at heart I think but she has lived in a terrible underworld of Jews and socialists and Cambridge dons and is not really house-trained”; but even Hugh, a liberal to his fingertips, could complain in 1940 of “a most unpleasant Jewish voice with a guttural accent” without any sense of what it was he was saying. And when one reads comments like Felix’s from California that war is a terrible thing and “we are all of us guilty”, one realizes the gulfs that divide even cultured Westerners, never mind the West and the rest of the world. Needless to say, none of this surfaces in Jeremy Lewis’s book, and I wonder in the end what such books are for. It gives us a lot of facts, such as that Raymond was the doctor who delivered Antonia Fraser, and that he later treated Guy the Gorilla’s thyroid problems; that Maxwell Knight of MI5 was a jazz drummer and clarinettist who smoked cigarettes through a long black holder and had a menagerie of parrots, monkeys, snakes “and, for a time, a bear, which walked behind him on a lead”, disliked Jews and homosexuals, wrote thrillers, admired Aleister Crowley, and was a close friend of Dennis Wheatley. This kind of thing is both the stuff and the bane of modern biography: rightly reluctant to tether themselves to the masts of the simplified moralities that animated biographers from Plutarch to Samuel Johnson, and to modern ideologies, whether Freudian or Marxist, biographers today (and do they abound!) remain tied to a feeble positivism, the belief that if you assemble enough grains of sand an interesting hill will emerge. It rarely does. Jeremy Lewis SHADES OF GREENE One generation of an English family 576pp. Cape. £25.978 0 224 07921 1 Gabriel Josipovici’s most recent novels, After and Making Mistakes, were both published last year, while his non-fiction book Whatever Happened to Modernism? appeared earlier this year. http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7166161.ece【上行】[record_atcl ctcl] critical reading http://www.douban.com/group/topic/13546831/

pa·ri·ah (p-r)n.1. A social outcast: "Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard" (Mark Twain).2. An Untouchable.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Tamil paaiyar, pl. of paaiyan, pariah caste, from paai, festival drum.]Word History: The word pariah, which can be used for anyone who is a social outcast, independent of social position, recalls a much more rigid social system, which made only certain people pariahs. The caste system of India placed pariahs, also known as Untouchables, very low in society. The word pariah, which we have extended in meaning, came into English from Tamil paaiyar, the plural of paaiyan, the caste name, which literally means "(hereditary) drummer" and comes from the word paai, the name of a drum used at certain festivals. The word is first recorded in English in 1613. Its use in English and its extension in meaning probably owe much to the long period of British rule in India.
