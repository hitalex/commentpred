BulletinHi there, I'm 【Ore】 with the BBC World News for Children. It's Friday the 26th of February. Coming up: A Winter Olympics special...we hear from pupils in the host city Vancouver! CLIP: "Just to be able to represent our country and home town like this. It's, 【it's really quite a blast.】" But first 【a round up of】 the rest of the day's big stories...Explosions and gunfire have left at least seventeen people dead in the Afghan capital - Kabul. Taliban militants said they carried out the attack on hotels and guesthouses in the heart of the city. 【It comes as】 American and European forces continue to crack down on the Taliban in the southwest of Afghanistan. Next - Portsmouth has become the first Premier League football club to go into administration. 【Administration happens】 when a club owes so much money to others that it can't look after its own bank accounts any more. Instead, the courts will choose some finance experts to make sure the club pays their bills and don't 【splash out on transfers or players they can't afford】. Under 【League rules】, 【Portsmouth will also lose nine points】, which means they are almost certain 【to be relegated】. Now - who's better Batman or Superman? Well when it comes to money Batman wins. Just days after one of the original Superman comics sold for exactly a million dollars - a comic featuring the first adventure of Batman sold in the U.S. for just over a million dollars. A big profit when you think that its original price was 10 cents! To the Winter Olympics now - this weekend will see the closing events of the games in Vancouver. So far the U.S. is 【racing ahead with 32 medals 】- their 【nearest threat】 is Germany who have 【notched up】 26. But even though hosts Canada aren't 【leading in the medals stakes】, they have plenty to celebrate. They secured their eighth gold medal of the Games 【with this 2-0 win over the United States】 in the final of the women's 【ice hockey】...... CLIP: "And Canada are the gold medalists in the women's ice hockey, for the third consecutive time. They did it at Salt Lake City , they've done it again in Turin - the Canadians are on top of the world in women's ice hockey." It was a very emotional moment for Canadian fans - the neighbouring countries are old rivals. 【Erin's a pupil at McMath Secondary school in Vancouver】 - she explained why it was especially important for her that Canada beat the U.S..... CLIP: "Not only in hockey - we have this rivalry with the U.S. It's because we're so close and we have, kind of, the same lifestyle. 【If we were playing Sweden】 or someone else in the final it wouldn't be, probably, as bad if we lost. If we lost to the U.S. it would be absolutely horrible." The games have been full of excitement - with hundreds of athletes competing in some of the most dangerous and 【extreme sports】 on the planet. So what have the best moments been for locals in the host city..... 【Erin, Dakota and Linea】 told us what the highlights had been for them...... CLIP: "【Alexandre Bilodeau】 winning Canada's first gold medal - it was 【insane】!" "There're lots of street parties , everyone's having lots of fun. It's very exiting at school, everyone's 【in their jerseys】 and everyone's taking about what events they've been to." "It's really【 neat 】to actually see the amount of people that are here, people from different countries and it's really cool." But not everyone thinks that hosting a big games is such a good idea - 【Adil】 is 16 years old - he reckons that the money it takes to put on a big event like this could be better spent..... CLIP: "The recession has caused a lot of 【downfall】 and a lot of debt in our economic region - in Vancouver. Wasting a lot of money 【on like, 】the building of the Olympic Oval - we just don't have enough money left to fix what really is the problem."But for 【Travis hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics has been a big deal... CLIP: "It means everything. Just to be able to represent our country and home town like this. It's, 【it's really quite a blast.】" And yesterday's question was all about Canada - we asked you what kind of leaf features on the Canadian flag, and the answer is the maple leaf. OK, that's all from the World News for Children team. We're back with more top stories and another question on Monday. Until then why not e-mail us and tell us where in the world you are. You can get us on cbbcnewsround@bbc.co.uk.
